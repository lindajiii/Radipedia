The extension of thin fibrous septa, arising from the expanded portal triads, into the adjacent liver parenchyma occurs in the next stage (stage F2). Further thickening and elongation of fibrous septa lead to the formation of fibrous bridges connecting adjacent portal triads and central veins (stage F3).

Image resolution is directly related to the extent of the k-space covered. If fewer lines of data are collected by symmetrically leaving out some of the outer portions of k-space, the scan time is reduced along with the image resolution (see Fig. 3-7). Another option is to collect all the data on one side of k-space, using the fact that the k-space of a purely real image is symmetric, and reduce the number of lines collected in the other half. This type of data col-lection is known as partial Fourier acquisition because the entire Fourier domain (k-space) has not been acquired. As an example, if the k-space matrix is 256 \u00d7 256, it would be possible to collect only 192 lines, which are not centered in k-space. Because only three fourths of the lines have been collected, the scan time is reduced by 25%. This type of acquisition is called 6/8 partial Fourier.\n",

Most studies apply either absolute rCBV or rCBV ratio (typically to contralateral normal gray or white matter) thresholds with varying sensitivity and specificity depending on chosen threshold. Studies have also suggested DSC perfusion imaging using rCBV to be superior to FDG PET for this Without the application of correction methods, other quantitative perfusion parameters can be obtained, namely percentage signal recov-ery (PSR) and peak height (PH), which have been shown to be useful independent parameters in differentiating glioma from metastasis and recurrent metastatic disease from radiation necrosis.18 Additionally, PSR has recently been shown to better distinguish between glioblas-toma, solitary metastasis, and PCL than rCBV.237Permeability MRI or dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI uses dynamic steady-state T1-weighted imaging after a gadolinium contrast bolus. High-grade intraaxial malignancy, namely glioma and metasta-ses, are dependent on neovascularity for growth, with formation of immature and \u201cleaky\u201d blood vessels resulting in increased capillary permeability.167 The most commonly measured and studied quantita-tive permeability parameter is Ktrans, a measure of the volume transfer of contrast between the blood plasma and extracellular space.402 Ktrans has been shown to correlate strongly with tumor grade,231,289,328 although threshold values are difficult to apply owing to variability in technique and the requirement of a complex model-based analysis. Therefore, various nonmodel-based semiquantitative indices have been suggested, which are derived from the time-signal intensity curve. The maximum slope of the initial vascular phase (MSIVP) has shown promise in differentiating radiation change (RC) and recurrent/progressive neoplasm (PD) with RC, demonstrating lower MSIVP values (see Fig. 9-69) than PD, which typically demonstrates a steep upslope in the initial vascular phase owing to permeable blood vessels268 (see Fig. 9-67). Using similar diagnostic criteria, high-grade neoplasm can often be differentiated from nonneoplastic lesions based on per-meability imaging.167 Additionally, preliminary studies have demon-strated correlation between Ktrans and histologic grade for atypical and typical meningiomas, a distinction that has not been demonstrated In summary, perfusion and permeability MRI are robust tech-niques that measure tumor vascularity, typically using DSC and DCE T1 MRI techniques, respectively.

In case 1.67, the patient also had pain after endoscopy. Surgical repair was necessary in both cases. Esophageal perforation usually is due to iatrogenic procedures (endoscopic perforations cause 75%-80% of all esophageal leaks and occur in about 1 of 1,000 patients undergoing fiberoptic endoscopy) or spontaneous perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) from violent retching or\nCase_type: vomiting.  Most endoscopic perforations involve the cervical\nesophagus near the cricopharyngeus muscle.  Spontaneous\nrupture nearly always occurs just above the gastroesophageal\njunction on the left.  Early detection of these perforations\nis critical to patient survival.  Small cervical esophageal\nleaks often can be treated conservatively, but large leaks\nmust be surgically repaired to prevent development of a\nretropharyngeal abscess.  Untreated thoracic esophageal\nperforations have at least a 70% mortality rate (due to\nmediastinitis) if the leak is undiscovered.  \nEsophageal perforations can be suspected from the\nchest radiograph by detection of pneumomediastinum,\nwidening of the mediastinum, hydropneumothorax, pleural\neffusion, and subcutaneous emphysema.  Perforations\nsuspected on the basis of the chest radiograph or on\nclinical grounds should be confirmed by an esophagram\nwith water-soluble contrast material.  Small leaks may be\noverlooked with water-soluble contrast agents, and\nnegative studies should be followed by barium\nesophagraphy. \nCT is excellent for evaluating patients with suspected\nor known esophageal perforation.  Small amounts of\nextravasated air (pneumomediastinum) or contrast material\nand its location within the chest can be identified readily.  ",

For example, Pirzkall et\u202fal.268 studied whether the metabolic information provided by MRSI-defined volumes could improve the accuracy of target volumes for radiotherapy treatment planning compared to target volumes defined by MRI. Using elevated Cho and decreased NAA as criteria, Pirzkall et\u202fal.268 compared the MRSI-defined volumes to that defined by the Gd-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted MRI studies. They found that the T2 studies estimated, as judged by the volume of the hyperin-tense T2 region, the region at risk of containing microscopic disease as being as much as 50% greater than by MRSI. On the other hand, the Gd-enhanced T1 MRI studies suggested a smaller tumor volume and a different location for highly active disease compared to the MRSI study (Fig. 17-7). They concluded that \u201cthe use of MRSI to define target volumes for RT treatment planning would increase, and change the location of the volume receiving a boost dose as well as reduce the volume receiving a standard dose.\u201d This study suggests that inclusion of MRSI data in the treatment planning process could potentially improve tumor control while reducing normal tissue radi-ation complications.

CT scans of the lung are usually obtained during maintained full inspiration. Normally the attenuation of lung parenchyma is determined by its relative proportions of blood, gas, extravascular fluid, and pulmonary tissue. The normal lung paren-chyma has a fairly homogeneous attenuation that is slightly greater than that of air. As lung gas volume is reduced, lung attenuation increases. A significant increase in attenuation of the lung parenchyma is seen on expiratory scans. Attenuation values are variable and influenced by the pulmonary volume and different parameters such as kilovoltage, patient size, and the particular region of the lung being assessed.

Although most cases of bronchiectasis in adults are idio-pathic, a variety of causes such as infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial), hypogammaglobulinemia and other immune deficien-cies (e.g., ABPA), dyskinetic cilia syndromes (Kartagener\u2019s syndrome), bronchial obstruction (e.g., foreign body, broncholithiasis, neoplasm), genetic disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis), congenital cartilage deficiency (e.g., Williams-Campbell syndrome), and pulmonary fibrosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.283 Kartagener\u2019s syndrome refers to the triad of situs inversus totalis, bronchiectasis, and either nasal polyps or recurrent sinusitis occurring in approximately half of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.283,398Although a chest radiograph must be the initial imaging examina-tion in patients with suspected bronchiectasis, in most instances radio-graphic findings are either nonexistent or nonspecific.232,233 HRCT scanning of the chest is the best test to establish this diagnosis, \u2003with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90%.344 Morphologically, bronchiectasis is described as cylindrical, varicose, or cystic in type. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is generally established by recognition of characteristic CT signs. Bronchial wall thickness on thin-section CT scans should be evaluated with window centers between \u2212250 and \u2212700\u202fHU and with window widths greater than 1000\u202fHU. Other than window settings, notably window widths less than 1000\u202fHU, can lead to substantial artificial thickening of bronchial walls.47 Cylindrical bronchiectasis is characterized by smooth uniformly dilated bronchi. When the dilated bronchus is sectioned lengthwise the parallel thick-ened airway walls resemble a railroad track or tram track, and sec-tioned crosswise they appear round or oval; because each bronchus is accompanied by a pulmonary artery, bronchiectasis commonly pro-duces a signet ring sign (Fig. 36-67). Lack of bronchial tapering is also an important sign in the diagnosis of bronchial dilatation. When dilated bronchi are filled with inspissated material, mucoid impaction results. On a CT scan, mucous plugs are identified by recognizing the branching tubular nature of the opacity on multiple CT sections. The term tree-in-bud refers to the presence of nodular and branching struc-tures, reflecting the presence of dilated mucus- or pus-filled centri-lobular bronchioles (cellular bronchiolitis). Tree-in-bud and air trapping (on expiratory scans) are findings commonly seen in patients with bronchiectasis. Beaded dilatation of bronchi resembling a string of pearls describes the varicose bronchiectasis. Cystic bronchiectasis is characterized by cysts in clusters, resembling a cluster of grapes (Fig. 36-68). Air-fluid levels resulting from retained secretions or superim-posed infection are commonly identified in cystically dilated bronchi. Bronchial postinflammatory changes during or immediately after an episode of acute pneumonia may simulate bronchiectasis; these changes (reversible bronchiectasis) revert to normal in 1 to 3 months.459 Traction bronchiectasis refers to irreversible dilatation of bronchi and bronchioles in areas of pulmonary fibrosis.154,635Bronchiectasis related to ABPA are seen most commonly in patients with longstanding bronchial asthma. They are characterized pathologi-cally by the presence of plugs of inspissated mucus containing Aspergil-lus organisms and eosinophils. Radiologic manifestations include homogeneous tubular finger-in-glove opacities in a bronchial distribu-tion, usually involving predominantly or exclusively the upper lobes.425 These shadows are related to plugging of airways by hyphal masses with distal mucous impaction and can migrate from one region to another.

Because the liver receives the majority of its blood supply from the portal vein, portal venous obstruction results in the recruitment of arterial blood to supply the ischemic region. The additional arterial supply explains the hyperenhancement seen during the early phases of contrast enhancement.

If there is any question of a possible neck or spine injury, the patient will be immobilized, requiring that the chest and abdomen be scanned with the arms down instead of in the preferred position above the head. Furthermore, for true emergencies the operator may be required to scan the patient as a Jane or John Doe if no identifying information is available, and the order for the exam may be given ver-bally by a physician accompanying the patient to the scan room.\n"
