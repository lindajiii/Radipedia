Performing an alternative imaging modality, e.g. CT if it was not visible on MRI, or MRI if it was not visible on CT.

More importantly, this provision preserves specificity for HCC by preventing attribution of growth to nonmass benign processes such as arterial perfusion alterations which may appear larger on one exam than on a prior due to changes in arterial phase timing or other factors.

In select patients, alternative surveillance strategies such as CT or MRI may be used for this purpose.\n\u2022Circulating biomarkers such as serum alpha fetoprotein may be used for surveillance in combination with imaging tests.\n\u2022LI-RADS US Surveillance addresses the use of US for surveillance and suggests when alternative surveillance strategies may be appropriate in select patients.\nDiagnostic tests are used to further characterize positive surveillance tests or to characterize incidentally detected observations. Similar to surveillance, the accuracy of diagnostic tests relies on the pre-test probability of disease. Hence, diagnostic algorithms should be applied only in high-risk populations.\n\u2022Ideally, diagnostic tests should have high specificity so the presence of HCC can be confirmed.\n\u2022In North America, the imaging modalities most commonly used for HCC diagnosis are multiphase contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. These modalities cover the entire liver and assess the extent (stage) of HCC.\n\u2022Another modality used for HCC diagnosis is contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). This modality typically permits detailed characterization of sonographically visible observations. It may not reliably visualize the entire liver; hence, it is suitable for diagnosis but not usually for staging.\n\u2022Multiphase imaging is a requirement for HCC diagnosis; hence, single-phase imaging exams are not considered diagnostic tests for HCC. LI-RADS CT/MRI and LI-RADS CEUS address the use of the corresponding modalities for diagnosis.\nThe distinction between surveillance vs. diagnosis may be blurred.\nIn some radiology practices, multiphase contrast-enhanced imaging exams are performed for  surveillance.
