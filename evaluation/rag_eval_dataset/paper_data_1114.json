Significant shortening of scanning time limits respiratory and cardiac motion artifacts, and in some instances the total dose of iodin-ated contrast material can be reduced. Dual-energy CT applications for imaging the mediastinum are not yet well established but may be helpful in quantifying perfusion, a potentially helpful marker in dif-ferentiating benign from malignant processes.182Volumetric CT data sets can be effectively reconstructed in a variety of nonaxial planes, often facilitating interpretation of mediastinal abnormalities. Application of nonaxial two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) reconstruction techniques has proved most useful for imaging abnormalities of the central airways and great vessels (Figs. 38-27 and 38-28). For example, in the evaluation of stenoses in obliquely oriented bronchi, these reconstruction techniques can improve diagnostic accuracy and confidence in the interpretation. It should be emphasized, however, that axial CT images are usually suf-ficient for diagnosis. Nevertheless, because 2D and 3D images present anatomic information in a context more familiar to clinicians, these methods may demonstrate the location and extent of an abnormality in a way that radiologic reports and axial CT images often do not and can be helpful in treatment planning.\n", "d76fbf37-7446-41e5-9be0-fbacb7aaaa0b": "89.\t Fujiyoshi F, Ichinari N, Fukukura Y, et\u202fal: Sclerosing hemangioma of the lung: MR findings and correlation with pathological features.

Once the tube current is chosen to achieve a target noise level and varied based on the general density of the body region, there is still a large difference in attenuation between lateral projections and AP/PA projections. This difference is pronounced for most of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis when patients are imaged in supine or prone positions, and is especially pronounced in the shoul-ders and hips because of the dense bones that are superimposed in lateral projections. For scanners capable of varying the current within a single tube rotation, a modulation scheme may be available to reduce the current for AP and PA projections and increase it for lateral projec-tions. In a variation of this approach, azimuthal modulation can be used to target exposure reduction to certain organs. For example, to reduce radiation dose to the eyes during a head scan or to the breasts during a chest scan, the azimuthal modulation can be modified to further reduce the mAs during the AP projection and compensate with increasing mAs for the lateral and/or PA projections.\n", "6b25b661-e414-48e6-b13a-eca6320a42ee": "MRI studies may help differentiate melanomas from other ocular lesions, evaluate their intraorbital extent, and search for metastatic disease.55 On MRI studies the amount of melanin contained in mela-noma determines the signal characteristics.

Studies have shown a near 100% sensitivity for detection of insulinomas with the combination of intraoperative ultrasonography and palpation of the gland. In addition to detection of pancreatic tumors, intraoperative ultrasonography is a valuable tool for evaluating the relationship of the tumor to the pancreatic duct.

Without an adequate margin, a partial pancreatectomy is performed. Intraoperative ultra- sonography also is used commonly after tumor enucleation to assess for damage to the pancreatic duct.

The functional consequences of an acute SCI are variable. Patients with incomplete SCI have some chance of neurologic recovery; the prognosis is far less optimistic for patients with complete injuries. The 2015 American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Standards is used for the neurologic assessment of adult patients with acute SCI (Fig. 28-33). MRI is often helpful in determin-ing the location and severity of neurologic compromise and identify-ing injury to non-bony structures.110SCI findings can be subdivided into those that relate to extrinsic compression and those that traumatize the cord parenchyma itself. Fractures with bony retropulsion, disk extrusions, and epidural hema-tomas can result in cord compression. Preexisting spondylosis and spinal stenosis will accentuate the vulnerability of the cord to extrinsic compression (Fig. 28-34). The extent of maximum spinal canal com-pression is more reliable than presence of canal stenosis for predicting the neurologic outcome after SCI.30,69The spectrum of cord parenchymal injuries include edema (low T1 and high T2 signal), swelling (defined as a smooth enlargement of the cord contour), and hemorrhage (Fig. 28-35). Acute intramedullary hemorrhage is seen as a focus of T2 shortening (hypointensity). \u2003Cervical cord hematomas have a strong correlation with a complete neurologic deficit: ASIA A, with the highest lesions carrying an increased risk of fatality (especially at the cervicomedullary junction in the setting of occipitoatlantal dislocation).69 Spinal cord edema increases significantly during the early time period after injury, whereas intramedullary hemorrhage is comparatively static.

Confirmation of the correct scan parameters prior to initiating CT acquisition is an important timeout to verify that the appropriate radiation dose is used and the required image quality is obtained. CT operators may be assisted in confirming the correct scan parameters or planned CTDIvol by having reference tables of expected CTDIvol ranges for different patient sizes and different proto-cols. Alternatively, if a prescan estimate of the size-specific dose esti-mate (SSDE)9 is available, a table of expected SSDE vales for different scan protocols may be reviewed. SSDE is a dose index that incorporates patient size or attenuation. Correction factors based on patient size are applied to the average CTDIvol value for the scan.

There is both small and large bowel distention with no evidence of mechanical obstruction. There are numerous causes, the most common being recent abdominal surgery (Box 4-2). This cause is multifactorial, due partly to the trauma to the small bowel (i.e., handling by the sur-geon) combined with the numerous anesthetic and pain medi-cations, which render the small bowel relatively functionless.
