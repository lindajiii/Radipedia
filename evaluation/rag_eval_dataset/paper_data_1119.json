The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109).

FNH typi-cally consists of two components: hyperplastic hepatocytes and a central scar. Hyperplastic hepatocytes are considered to be a proliferative response of hepatocytes secondary to an under-lying perfusion disorder (34).
