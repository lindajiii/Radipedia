      "B-HCA accounts for 15%–18% of all HCAs. Compared with the other HCA subtypes, B-HCA occurs more frequently in men (4). Owing to β-catenin gene mutation, B-HCA has the high-est risk for malignant transformation. In addition, B-HCA is the most common HCA subtype that takes up gadoxetic acid. According to previous reports (59,63,66), more than 80% of B-HCA lesions show isointensity or hyperintensity during the HBP (Fig 6). It also has been reported that glutamine synthetase and OATP1B3, which are downstream targets of the Wnt/β-catenin path-way, are diffusely positive in immunohistochemi-cal studies of B-HCA (4,67). Such preserved or increased OATP1B3 expression has been shown to correlate with the hyperintensity seen during the HBP (63,68).

      "In addition to standardization, structured reports provide several benefits. In a clinical setting, a structured report improves clarity of communica-tion, reduces variability in key feature descrip-tion, and links individual observations to staging and treatment recommendations (19,20). Struc-tured reports promote adherence to guidelines and diagnostics systems, while appropriately doc-umenting technique (21). Finally, they encourage a consistent pattern for image analysis that may reduce diagnostic errors and potentially improve workflow (8,9). Flusberg et al (7) reported sig-nificant differences in the frequencies of report-ing important elements of HCC imaging, such as major features (Fig 1), observation size, and location, when comparing free-text reports to LI-RADS templates. Structured reports are es-sential for data mining, facilitating calculation of diagnostic performance, and pooling of data from different sites for multicenter studies (11). To our knowledge, no studies have shown det-rimental effects of structured reports. However, criticisms include the risk for errors if prepopu-lated information is not adequately removed, a potential loss of the big picture due to overly structured content, and limitations for describ-ing more complex cases due to rigid and limited descriptors (22). Implementation of structured reports also requires an adaptation period during clinical adoption, which may momentarily affect workflow and productivity (5).\n",

The hyperplastic area is slightly hypointense to hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, with intense homogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase (35). In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36).

The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides guidance for standardized report-ing of liver observations in patients who are at risk for HCC. LI-RADS standardized reporting intends to inform patient treatment and facilitate multidisciplinary communication and decisions, taking into consideration individual clinical factors. Depending on the con-text, observations may be reported individually, in aggregate, or as a combination of both. LI-RADS provides two templates for reporting liver observations: in a single continuous paragraph or in a structured format with keywords and imaging findings. The authors clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting, highlight the benefits of structured reports, discuss the applicability of LI-RADS for liver CT and MRI, review the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report, provide guidance on the description of LI-RADS observations ex-emplified with two case-based reporting templates, illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios, and discuss future directions.\n",

      "T o  r e d u c e  t h e  i n t e r o b s e r ve r variability and inconsistency in interpretation and reporting of findings at liver imaging, scoring systems have been developed. In 2012, American College of Radiology developed the Liver Imaging–Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for standardizing terminology and criteria for interpreting and reporting findings of CT and MRI examinations of the liver in patients with cirrhosis or increased risk of HCC. The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified. This version applies to multiphase CT and MRI examinations performed with conventional extracellular contrast materials. It currently, does not apply to hepatobiliary specific gadolinium-based agents.\n",

      " \"Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI is a valuable tool for detecting hepatic tumors. Peritumoral retention refers to the accumulation of the contrast agent in the surrounding liver tissue adjacent to a tumor. This phenomenon is commonly observed in cholangiocarcinomas, bile duct carcinomas, and cholangiocholangiocarcinomas. The underlying histopathological explanation is the disruption of normal bile flow, leading to the accumulation of gadoxetic acid in the peritumoral liver tissue. This disruption can be caused by the tumor's invasion into the bile ducts or the formation of bile ductules within the tumor itself. The resulting bile duct obstruction or stenosis leads to the retention of gadoxetic acid in the peritumoral liver tissue, making it a useful diagnostic tool for these tumors.  \n",

      " It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration. Thus, this enhancement pattern during the HBP is re-ferred to as a targetoid pattern.\n",

Peritumoral hyperplasia is also ob-served in other hepatic tumors, such as neuroen-docrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, metastatic colon carcinomas, hemangiomas, and hepatoblastomas (100).

During the HBP, IPNB demonstrates a dilated enhanced bile duct with filling defects caused by mucin retention or a solid component of the tumor (Fig 15) (104–106). Note that when there is a large amount of mucin in a bile duct, it results in marked bile duct dilatation and obvious im-paired liver function. In this setting, the hepatocel-lular uptake of gadoxetic acid and secretion of this agent into the bile duct have obviously decreased and led to nonenhancement of the biliary ducts during the HBP (106). The addition of diffusion-weighted imaging to the gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI examination has the potential to improve the conspicuity of intraductal tumors in IPNB and is helpful in determining tumor invasiveness (107).\n",

      "The normal functioning hepatocytes uptake the hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents and excrete them into the biliary system due to cellular membrane transporters. The contrast agent is responsible for shortening the T1 relaxation, which results in higher signal intensity of the healthy liver parenchyma on T1-WI in the hepatobiliary phase[1]. In the later (hepatobiliary) phase, there is also a subsequent excretion into the biliary canaliculi, allowing imaging of the biliary pathways. Therefore, the hepato-biliary phase is easily recognized because the normal liver parenchyma and bile ducts appear enhanced[41]. Non-hepatocellular lesions, as well as lesions with impaired hepatocytes, appear hypointense. In short, as liver metastases lack functioning hepatocytes and biliary ducts, they appear hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase. Allergic reactions are infrequent and comparable with those of extracellular GBCAs.\n",

This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

      " Peritumoral retention during the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can be observed in various types of hepatic tumors, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors and neuroendocrine tumors. The underlying histopathological explanation for this phenomenon is peritumoral hyperplasia, which is defined as a rim of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding the tumor. This hyperplastic rim can cause the retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space, leading to the observed peritumoral enhancement. \n",

      " Regarding CEUS, reports differ, mainly because they depend more on operator expertise and other technical factors. Bernatik et al[11] found that CEUS detected 97% of the lesions diagnosed by CT[8,11]. Piscaglia et al[12] examined 109 patients with colorectal and gastric cancer. They showed that CEUS improves sensitivity in the detection of liver metastases to 95.4% when compared to conventional US (76.9%) and CT (90.8%)[12]. Cantisani et al[8,13] showed that CEUS improved US sensitivity from 67.4%-71.6% to 93.4%-95.8%. On the other hand, Vialle et al[14] reported that the CEUS sensitivity was inferior to CT in detecting hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CEUS 64.5% vs CT 80.4%). Moreover, since metastatic liver disease frequently shows multiple lesions, the per-lesion evaluation would need multiple doses of ultrasound contrast agent[7].\n",

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

Key concepts include CEUS, MRI, CT, and their respective sensitivities and specificities. Diagnostic methods include CEUS, MRI, CT, and PET/CT. System guidelines include CEUS, MRI, CT, and PET/CT. Medical research findings include studies comparing DE-CT-driven low-keV virtual monoenergetic imaging to standard linearly blended images, and the sensitivity of MRI and GA-MRI being approximately 87.1% and 86.9%, respectively. These findings support the use of GA-MRI as a superior imaging method for detecting liver metastases, especially in cases of concomitant liver steatosis. The economic implication of using CT over MRI is also highlighted. Therefore, the current consensus is that MRI is still considered a second-line method, but its superior sensitivity makes it a superior imaging method for detecting liver metastases.\n",

      "With the introduction of surgical removal of metastatic liver nodules, the overall survival rate has increased. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the best imaging method to detect them, mainly the smaller ones, which can be easily missed. Ko et al[50] showed that the sensitivity of CT was 8%, 55%, 91%, and 100% for nodules of 1-5 mm, 6-10 mm, 11-15 mm, and > 20 mm, respectively. Consequently, it appears obvious that in metastases that are \"too small to characterize,\" CT has a limited role, particularly for those smaller than 5 mm[50]. However, GA-MRI and CE-CT seem equivalent for detecting lesions larger than 10 mm[21,26].\n",

      "UltrasonographyUltrasonography (US) is a safe, accessible, and inexpensive technique. Nevertheless, it has considerable limitations, including dependency on operator expertise, patient’s body habitus, cooperation, and bowel gas interposition[8]. The lower performance of this technique is also explained by limited spatial resolution, and for this reason, small (< 3-5 mm), isoechoic, and deep-seated metastases can be missed[1,8]. The conven-tional US's general sensitivity for detecting liver metastases is approximately 69% (sensitivity of 50%-76% in series with a true gold standard – intraoperative US or resection)[1,9]. This sensitivity is probably lower in patients with subdiaphragmatic lesions, chronic hepatic disease, and severe hepatic steatosis, which may be induced by chemotherapy. Moreover, the ambiguity in segmental localization leads to a lack of reproducibility compared to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n",

      " Liver resection surgery often requires identifying and preserving the future liver remnant (FLR) to maintain liver function. One procedure aimed at increasing the function and size of the FLR is hepatic vein ligation. This technique involves ligating the hepatic veins to reduce blood flow to the portion of the liver that will be resected, thereby increasing the blood flow to the remaining liver tissue. Another procedure is hepatic artery embolization, which involves blocking the hepatic artery to reduce blood flow to the liver, allowing the remaining liver tissue to hypertrophy. Both of these procedures are important for radiologists to be familiar with in centers where liver resections are performed, as they can help ensure that the FLR is adequately sized and functioning, which is critical for the patient's overall outcome.  \n",

      "Dynamic imaging is crucial, and its concept, perception, and evaluation are similar between CT and MRI (Figure 2). Most liver metastases are hypovascular and are best detected during the portal venous phase (PVP), which begins approximately 60-80 s after the initial injection. In this phase, the liver parenchyma enhances through the dominant blood supply by the portal vein. Hypovascular metastases appear as hypodense/hypoattenuating lesions compared to the background liver parenchyma (Figure 3)[1]. They usually show a peripheral rim enhancement in the late arterial phase (LAP), which fades centrally in the venous phase (“target appearance”)[5,6]. On the other hand, hypervascular metastases enhance earlier in the LAP, which is demonstrated by contrast in the portal vein and absence in the hepatic veins. These lesions may fade and become isodense with the remaining liver parenchyma or show variable degrees of washout in the PVP and delayed acquisitions[5,6,20].\n",

The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109).

      "MRI best characterizes focal cirrhotic liver lesions. USG can detect focal lesions but cannot reliably characterize them. CT can reliably characterize the focal lesions and differentiate between regenerative nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may not be able to reliably differentiate dysplastic nodules from regenerative nodules or from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence CT is still less sensitive as well as specific than MRI. MRI is most reliable investigation for suspected hepatocellular malignancy- in detection and also for monitoring of patients in whom the lesions are detected previously. Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion.\n",

Enhanced nondistorted biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging find-ings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma.

This expression is correlated with the isointensity or hyperintensity seen during the HBP (24). The molecular mechanism of FNH might involve the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway without any mutations in the β-catenin gene. This finding could explain the equal or stronger expression of OATP1B3 in both conditions.\n",

      " OATP1B3 overexpression in HCCs is associated with β-catenin and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α activation. In HCCs with β-catenin gene mutation, OATP1B3 expression is higher, and this correlates with accelerated bile production, pseudoglandular pattern, and hyperintensity during the HBP (25, 26). This suggests a positive relationship between OATP1B3 overexpression and molecular mechanisms involving β-catenin and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α activation. \n",

      "Dynamic imaging is crucial, and its concept, perception, and evaluation are similar between CT and MRI (Figure 2). Most liver metastases are hypovascular and are best detected during the portal venous phase (PVP), which begins approximately 60-80 s after the initial injection. In this phase, the liver parenchyma enhances through the dominant blood supply by the portal vein. Hypovascular metastases appear as hypodense/hypoattenuating lesions compared to the background liver parenchyma (Figure 3)[1]. They usually show a peripheral rim enhancement in the late arterial phase (LAP), which fades centrally in the venous phase (“target appearance”)[5,6]. On the other hand, hypervascular metastases enhance earlier in the LAP, which is demonstrated by contrast in the portal vein and absence in the hepatic veins. These lesions may fade and become isodense with the remaining liver parenchyma or show variable degrees of washout in the PVP and delayed acquisitions[5,6,20].\n",

In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36). The majority of hyperplas-tic areas are isointense or hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver tissue during the HBP. This finding enables differential diagnosis (37) because most hypervascular liver masses show hypointensity during the HBP.\n",

      " The understanding of the mechanisms of hyperintensity in hepatic mass lesions during the HBP is crucial for image interpretation. Hyperintensity can be caused by uptake by hyperplastic hepatocytes, tumor cells, retention in extracellular space, peritumoral retention, or biliary enhancement in the tumor. Accurately identifying the cause of hyperintensity can aid in differential diagnosis and help in understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions. This understanding is particularly important in the context of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, where the retention of gadoxetic acid by normal hepatocytes can lead to hyperintensity. \n",

In 2012, American College of Radiology developed the Liver Imaging–Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for standardizing terminology and criteria for interpreting and reporting findings of CT and MRI examinations of the liver in patients with cirrhosis or increased risk of HCC. The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified. This version applies to multiphase CT and MRI examinations performed with conventional extracellular contrast materials. It currently, does not apply to hepatobiliary specific gadolinium-based agents.\n",

In the HBP, NRH shows hyperintensity, with relative hypointensity in the central region of the lesion; this finding is seen as ring or doughnut-like enhancement.

In the Yoneda et al study (99), peritumoral retention with partial enhancement was observed in 50% of HCCs. Histopathologically, peritumoral retention corre-sponds to peritumoral hyperplasia, which is defined as a rim of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding the tumor. Peritumoral hyperplasia is also ob-served in other hepatic tumors, such as neuroen-docrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, metastatic colon carcinomas, hemangiomas, and hepatoblastomas (100). Thus, these tumors also can show peritumoral retention during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI (Figs 13, 14).\n",

      "It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration.

      "Gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, is becoming increasingly important in the detection and characterization of hepatic mass lesions. This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

      "Gadoxetic acid (gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [Eovist or Primovist; Bayer Healthcare, Berlin,Germany]) is a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI (1,2). This agent is becoming increas-ingly important for detecting and characterizing lesions in patients known or suspected to have hepatic mass lesions (3,4). During the hepato-biliary phase (HBP), hepatic mass lesions with-out functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity relative to the background liver tissue.

      " Regarding CEUS, reports differ, mainly because they depend more on operator expertise and other technical factors. Bernatik et al[11] found that CEUS detected 97% of the lesions diagnosed by CT[8,11]. Piscaglia et al[12] examined 109 patients with colorectal and gastric cancer. They showed that CEUS improves sensitivity in the detection of liver metastases to 95.4% when compared to conventional US (76.9%) and CT (90.8%)[12]. Cantisani et al[8,13] showed that CEUS improved US sensitivity from 67.4%-71.6% to 93.4%-95.8%. On the other hand, Vialle et al[14] reported that the CEUS sensitivity was inferior to CT in detecting hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CEUS 64.5% vs CT 80.4%). Moreover, since metastatic liver disease frequently shows multiple lesions, the per-lesion evaluation would need multiple doses of ultrasound contrast agent[7].\n",

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

      "With the introduction of surgical removal of metastatic liver nodules, the overall survival rate has increased. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the best imaging method to detect them, mainly the smaller ones, which can be easily missed. Ko et al[50] showed that the sensitivity of CT was 8%, 55%, 91%, and 100% for nodules of 1-5 mm, 6-10 mm, 11-15 mm, and > 20 mm, respectively. Consequently, it appears obvious that in metastases that are \"too small to characterize,\" CT has a limited role, particularly for those smaller than 5 mm[50].

Key concepts include CEUS, MRI, CT, and their respective sensitivities and specificities. Diagnostic methods include CEUS, MRI, CT, and PET/CT. System guidelines include CEUS, MRI, CT, and PET/CT. Medical research findings include studies comparing DE-CT-driven low-keV virtual monoenergetic imaging to standard linearly blended images, and the sensitivity of MRI and GA-MRI being approximately 87.1% and 86.9%, respectively. These findings support the use of GA-MRI as a superior imaging method for detecting liver metastases, especially in cases of concomitant liver steatosis. The economic implication of using CT over MRI is also highlighted. Therefore, the current consensus is that MRI is still considered a second-line method, but its superior sensitivity makes it a superior imaging method for detecting liver metastases.\n",

      "with cirrhosis, US does not allow detection of more than one-half of early-stage HCCs (26). This is partly explained by the poor acoustic window because of cirrhosis, body habitus, or liver steato­sis (6). Prospective evaluation has shown reduced sensitivity and specificity and higher likelihood of US inadequacy in male patients and in those with a larger body habitus, an echogenic or nodular liver due to high fat content or fibrosis, and ascites (6,27,28). Studies have shown that the per-patient sensitivity of US for small HCCs (<2 cm), defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A, is as low as 47%–63% (5,26,29). A 13-year meta-analysis (30) in which US was compared with al­ternative surveillance strategies found US to have the lowest overall sensitivity and positive predictive value (59.3% and 77.4%, respectively), compared with contrast material–enhanced CT (73.6% and 85.8%, respectively) and contrast-enhanced MRI (77.5% and 83.6%, respectively). US with intravascular contrast material im­proves liver lesion conspicuity compared with that at standard US (31). However, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of intravascular contrast–enhanced US in primary surveillance of liver cancers. Growing evidence supports the use of perfluorobutane microbubble enhance­ment with US. This contrast agent is taken up by the Kupffer cells, allowing for Kupffer phase imaging, which is similar to hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at MRI with hepatobiliary agents. In a randomized controlled study (32) comparing perfluorobutane-enhanced US to gray-scale US for surveillance of HCC, Kupffer phase imaging allowed detection of significantly smaller HCCs. Unfortunately, at this time, Kupffer cell contrast-enhanced US agents are not available for use in the United States.\n",

      "Biliary tract enhancement is caused by the physiologic excretion of gadoxetic acid into the bile ducts and therefore is usually strong. IPNB can show a dilated enhanced bile duct with fill-ing defects caused by mucin retention or a solid component of the tumor. Enhanced nondistorted biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging find-ings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. The differential diagnosis of hyperintense liver masses seen during the HBP is summarized in Figure 17.\n",

      "At MRI, lymphomas of the liver are homoge-neously hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109). Similarly, nondistorted enhancing biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging findings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (Fig 16) (110).\n",

      "MRI best characterizes focal cirrhotic liver lesions. USG can detect focal lesions but cannot reliably characterize them. CT can reliably characterize the focal lesions and differentiate between regenerative nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may not be able to reliably differentiate dysplastic nodules from regenerative nodules or from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence CT is still less sensitive as well as specific than MRI. MRI is most reliable investigation for suspected hepatocellular malignancy- in detection and also for monitoring of patients in whom the lesions are detected previously. Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion.\n",

This expression is correlated with the isointensity or hyperintensity seen during the HBP (24). The molecular mechanism of FNH might involve the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway without any mutations in the β-catenin gene. This finding could explain the equal or stronger expression of OATP1B3 in both conditions.\n",

      "B-HCA accounts for 15%–18% of all HCAs. Compared with the other HCA subtypes, B-HCA occurs more frequently in men (4). Owing to β-catenin gene mutation, B-HCA has the high-est risk for malignant transformation. In addition, B-HCA is the most common HCA subtype that takes up gadoxetic acid. According to previous reports (59,63,66), more than 80% of B-HCA lesions show isointensity or hyperintensity during the HBP (Fig 6). It also has been reported that glutamine synthetase and OATP1B3, which are downstream targets of the Wnt/β-catenin path-way, are diffusely positive in immunohistochemi-cal studies of B-HCA (4,67). Such preserved or increased OATP1B3 expression has been shown to correlate with the hyperintensity seen during the HBP (63,68). Otherwise, no discriminant characteristics of the lesion pattern of B-HCA have been found.\n",

      "Gadoxetic acid is a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, which is becoming increasingly important for detecting and characterizing lesions in patients with hepatic mass lesions. During the HBP, hepatatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity relative to the background liver tissue. However, some lesions show hyperintensity during the HBP due to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. Understanding the causes of hyperintensity during the HBP is important for precise imaging-based diagnosis and for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions. The advantages of using gadoxetic acid include improved detection of hepatic masses, especially small lesions, and its role in characterizing hepatic mass lesions. However, it is also important to identify the specific causes of hyperintensity seen during the HBP. This review highlights the importance of understanding the causes of hyperintensity during the HBP and the role of gadoxetic acid in characterizing hep\n",

      "At MRI, findings of FNH typically include areas of peripheral hyperplastic hepatocytes and central scars (Fig 2). The hyperplastic area is slightly hypointense to hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, with intense homogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase (35). In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36). The majority of hyperplas-tic areas are isointense or hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver tissue during the HBP.

      " Hyperintensity in hepatic mass lesions during the HBP can be caused by various mechanisms, including uptake by hyperplastic hepatocytes, retention in extracellular space, and biliary enhancement. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for accurate image interpretation, as it enables radiologists to differentiate between various types of lesions, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and other lesions. The understanding of these mechanisms also contributes to the pathogenesis of these lesions, allowing radiologists to better comprehend the underlying biology and pathology of these conditions. This knowledge is essential for precise diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. \n",

      "Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compris-ing the vast majority of primary liver malignancies. Imaging plays a central role in HCC diagnosis and management. As a result, the content and structure of radiology reports are of utmost importance in guiding clinical management. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides guidance for standardized report-ing of liver observations in patients who are at risk for HCC.

The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified.

      " The primary hepatic tumors that can exhibit peritumoral retention are intraductal papillomas and hepatoid cell carcinomas. This phenomenon is due to the presence of bile ducts within the tumor, which can lead to the retention of contrast agent in the surrounding tissue. This retention can be seen on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI as a \"ring of bright\" or \"ring of enhancement\" around the tumor, indicating that the tumor is not as avascular as initially thought.  \n",

      " Peritumoral retention during the HBP of gadox-etic acid–enhanced MRI appears as a hyperintense rim surrounding the tumor. This rim is occasion-ally observed in HCCs (Fig 12). In the Yoneda et al study (99), peritumoral retention with partial enhancement was observed in 50% of HCCs. Histopathologically, peritumoral retention corre-sponds to peritumoral hyperplasia, which is defined as a rim of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding the tumor. Peritumoral hyperplasia is also ob-served in other hepatic tumors, such as neuroen-docrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, metastatic colon carcinomas, hemangiomas, and hepatoblastomas (100). Thus, these tumors also can show peritumoral retention during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI (Figs 13, 14).\n",

      "It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration.

      "Gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, is becoming increasingly important in the detection and characterization of hepatic mass lesions. This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

      "Hemangioma is the most common benign hepatic neoplasm, typically appearing as a well-defined mass on MRI. On conventional extracellular contrast-enhanced MRI, it shows peripheral nodular enhancement followed by centripetal enhancement. The prolonged and delayed enhancement is due to contrast material entering the multiple vascular channels and slowly filling the lesion. Some hemangiomas may show slight central high signal intensity, even during the early HBP. The hyperintensity caused by gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space tends to be lower compared with the hyperintensity caused by transporter uptake of gadoxetic acid.

They showed that CEUS improves sensitivity in the detection of liver metastases to 95.4% when compared to conventional US (76.9%) and CT (90.8%)[12]. Cantisani et al[8,13] showed that CEUS improved US sensitivity from 67.4%-71.6% to 93.4%-95.8%. On the other hand, Vialle et al[14] reported that the CEUS sensitivity was inferior to CT in detecting hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CEUS 64.5% vs CT 80.4%).

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

      "In the current perspective of oncologic liver surgery or local ablation, imaging shows a vital role in the detection, characterization, and determination of metastases' exact location, on a per-patient and per-lesion basis, even in patients with stage IV disease. Surgery and various interventional radiologic techniques are also performed in selected patients with oligometastatic disease. Imaging plays an essential role in the workup of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) by helping enumerate the number and sites of metastases, determine resectability, assess response to systemic and liver-directed therapies, and detect drug toxicities and disease recurrences. Ultrasonography (US) is a safe, accessible, and inexpensive technique, but it has considerable limitations, including operator expertise, patient’s body habitus, cooperation, and bowel gas interposition. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has improved the sensitivity for the detection of liver metastases, particularly in patients with subdiaphragmatic lesions\n",

      "with cirrhosis, US does not allow detection of more than one-half of early-stage HCCs (26). This is partly explained by the poor acoustic window because of cirrhosis, body habitus, or liver steato­sis (6). Prospective evaluation has shown reduced sensitivity and specificity and higher likelihood of US inadequacy in male patients and in those with a larger body habitus, an echogenic or nodular liver due to high fat content or fibrosis, and ascites (6,27,28). Studies have shown that the per-patient sensitivity of US for small HCCs (<2 cm), defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A, is as low as 47%–63% (5,26,29). A 13-year meta-analysis (30) in which US was compared with al­ternative surveillance strategies found US to have the lowest overall sensitivity and positive predictive value (59.3% and 77.4%, respectively), compared with contrast material–enhanced CT (73.6% and 85.8%, respectively) and contrast-enhanced MRI (77.5% and 83.6%, respectively). US with intravascular contrast material im­proves liver lesion conspicuity compared with that at standard US (31). However, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of intravascular contrast–enhanced US in primary surveillance of liver cancers. Growing evidence supports the use of perfluorobutane microbubble enhance­ment with US. This contrast agent is taken up by the Kupffer cells, allowing for Kupffer phase imaging, which is similar to hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at MRI with hepatobiliary agents. In a randomized controlled study (32) comparing perfluorobutane-enhanced US to gray-scale US for surveillance of HCC, Kupffer phase imaging allowed detection of significantly smaller HCCs. Unfortunately, at this time, Kupffer cell contrast-enhanced US agents are not available for use in the United States.\n",

The lower performance of this technique is also explained by limited spatial resolution, and for this reason, small (< 3-5 mm), isoechoic, and deep-seated metastases can be missed[1,8]. The conven-tional US's general sensitivity for detecting liver metastases is approximately 69% (sensitivity of 50%-76% in series with a true gold standard – intraoperative US or resection)[1,9]. This sensitivity is probably lower in patients with subdiaphragmatic lesions, chronic hepatic disease, and severe hepatic steatosis, which may be induced by chemotherapy.

      "At MRI, lymphomas of the liver are homoge-neously hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109). Similarly, nondistorted enhancing biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging findings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (Fig 16) (110).\n",

      "MRI best characterizes focal cirrhotic liver lesions. USG can detect focal lesions but cannot reliably characterize them. CT can reliably characterize the focal lesions and differentiate between regenerative nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may not be able to reliably differentiate dysplastic nodules from regenerative nodules or from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence CT is still less sensitive as well as specific than MRI. MRI is most reliable investigation for suspected hepatocellular malignancy- in detection and also for monitoring of patients in whom the lesions are detected previously. Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion.\n",

      "Results and Conclusions: In cirrhosis, there is development of nodules which are initially only microscopically detectable. With progression of cirrhosis, there is development of radiologically detectable regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. Amongst these regenerative nodules are completely benign lesions whereas dysplastic nodules, though benign, are considered premalignant; and hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant condition. Differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions is possible on the basis of enhancement pattern in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion. Also, MRI characterization after gadolinium based contrast injection was found to be similar to the previous imaging based on non-gadolinium contrast agents.\n",

      "Dynamic imaging is crucial, and its concept, perception, and evaluation are similar between CT and MRI (Figure 2). Most liver metastases are hypovascular and are best detected during the portal venous phase (PVP), which begins approximately 60-80 s after the initial injection. In this phase, the liver parenchyma enhances through the dominant blood supply by the portal vein. Hypovascular metastases appear as hypodense/hypoattenuating lesions compared to the background liver parenchyma (Figure 3)[1]. They usually show a peripheral rim enhancement in the late arterial phase (LAP), which fades centrally in the venous phase (“target appearance”)[5,6]. On the other hand, hypervascular metastases enhance earlier in the LAP, which is demonstrated by contrast in the portal vein and absence in the hepatic veins. These lesions may fade and become isodense with the remaining liver parenchyma or show variable degrees of washout in the PVP and delayed acquisitions[5,6,20].\n",

The hyperplastic area is slightly hypointense to hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, with intense homogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase (35). In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36).

In 2012, American College of Radiology developed the Liver Imaging–Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for standardizing terminology and criteria for interpreting and reporting findings of CT and MRI examinations of the liver in patients with cirrhosis or increased risk of HCC. The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified. This version applies to multiphase CT and MRI examinations performed with conventional extracellular contrast materials. It currently, does not apply to hepatobiliary specific gadolinium-based agents.\n",

Widespread disease should be reported in ag-gregate, indicating the presence of widespread dis-ease, and include, if applicable, the size, features, and LI-RADS category of one or two of the largest or index observations, along with a description of aggregate, or by using a combination of the two, depending on the number of observations and their LI-RADS cat-egories. (b) In general, widespread disease, TIV, and lower-category observations should be reported in aggregate.\n",

In the Yoneda et al study (99), peritumoral retention with partial enhancement was observed in 50% of HCCs. Histopathologically, peritumoral retention corre-sponds to peritumoral hyperplasia, which is defined as a rim of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding the tumor. Peritumoral hyperplasia is also ob-served in other hepatic tumors, such as neuroen-docrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, metastatic colon carcinomas, hemangiomas, and hepatoblastomas (100).

      "It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration. Thus, this enhancement pattern during the HBP is re-ferred to as a targetoid pattern.\n",

      "Gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, is becoming increasingly important in the detection and characterization of hepatic mass lesions. This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

Bernatik et al[11] found that CEUS detected 97% of the lesions diagnosed by CT[8,11]. Piscaglia et al[12] examined 109 patients with colorectal and gastric cancer. They showed that CEUS improves sensitivity in the detection of liver metastases to 95.4% when compared to conventional US (76.9%) and CT (90.8%)[12]. Cantisani et al[8,13] showed that CEUS improved US sensitivity from 67.4%-71.6% to 93.4%-95.8%. On the other hand, Vialle et al[14] reported that the CEUS sensitivity was inferior to CT in detecting hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CEUS 64.5% vs CT 80.4%).

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

      "with cirrhosis, US does not allow detection of more than one-half of early-stage HCCs (26). This is partly explained by the poor acoustic window because of cirrhosis, body habitus, or liver steato­sis (6). Prospective evaluation has shown reduced sensitivity and specificity and higher likelihood of US inadequacy in male patients and in those with a larger body habitus, an echogenic or nodular liver due to high fat content or fibrosis, and ascites (6,27,28). Studies have shown that the per-patient sensitivity of US for small HCCs (<2 cm), defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A, is as low as 47%–63% (5,26,29). A 13-year meta-analysis (30) in which US was compared with al­ternative surveillance strategies found US to have the lowest overall sensitivity and positive predictive value (59.3% and 77.4%, respectively), compared with contrast material–enhanced CT (73.6% and 85.8%, respectively) and contrast-enhanced MRI (77.5% and 83.6%, respectively). US with intravascular contrast material im­proves liver lesion conspicuity compared with that at standard US (31). However, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of intravascular contrast–enhanced US in primary surveillance of liver cancers. Growing evidence supports the use of perfluorobutane microbubble enhance­ment with US. This contrast agent is taken up by the Kupffer cells, allowing for Kupffer phase imaging, which is similar to hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at MRI with hepatobiliary agents. In a randomized controlled study (32) comparing perfluorobutane-enhanced US to gray-scale US for surveillance of HCC, Kupffer phase imaging allowed detection of significantly smaller HCCs. Unfortunately, at this time, Kupffer cell contrast-enhanced US agents are not available for use in the United States.\n",

      "At MRI, lymphomas of the liver are homoge-neously hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109). Similarly, nondistorted enhancing biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging findings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (Fig 16) (110).\n",

      "MRI best characterizes focal cirrhotic liver lesions. USG can detect focal lesions but cannot reliably characterize them. CT can reliably characterize the focal lesions and differentiate between regenerative nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may not be able to reliably differentiate dysplastic nodules from regenerative nodules or from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence CT is still less sensitive as well as specific than MRI. MRI is most reliable investigation for suspected hepatocellular malignancy- in detection and also for monitoring of patients in whom the lesions are detected previously. Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion.\n",

Hypovascular metastases appear as hypodense/hypoattenuating lesions compared to the background liver parenchyma (Figure 3)[1]. They usually show a peripheral rim enhancement in the late arterial phase (LAP), which fades centrally in the venous phase (“target appearance”)[5,6]. On the other hand, hypervascular metastases enhance earlier in the LAP, which is demonstrated by contrast in the portal vein and absence in the hepatic veins.

The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides guidance for standardized report-ing of liver observations in patients who are at risk for HCC. LI-RADS standardized reporting intends to inform patient treatment and facilitate multidisciplinary communication and decisions, taking into consideration individual clinical factors.

       "   'Radiology reports come in many forms, in-cluding free text, standardized, and structured. Free-text reports may lack clarity and consis-tency, potentially leading to errors in translation to management and longitudinal reporting (4–6). Conversely, standardized or structured reports streamline medical content by using precise ter-minology and are scripted to cover all clinically relevant data, promoting consistent and com-plete reporting of all data elements (5–8). They improve clinical care and workflow by providing systematic image analysis and reduced dictation times when compared with free-text reports (9). Furthermore, the adoption of structured reports facilitates data extraction for indexing, teaching, and research purposes (10,11). Different systems have been developed for the standardization of liver imaging (12). The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a comprehensive approach to all HCC imaging components, from image acquisition to interpre-tation. LI-RADS provides a precise lexicon of imaging features, unambiguous diagnostic cat-egories, and reporting templates for applying the system in practice. A central tenet of LI-RADS is standardization, which is intended to reduce in-terpretation variability, improve communication between health care providers, and ultimately improve patient care. A standardized LI-RADS report is intended to clearly and concisely reflect the radiologist’s diagnostic impression and pro-vides suggested management considerations (13). LI-RADS provides standardization in screening and surveillance with US; in diagnostic imaging with CT, MRI, and contrast-enhanced US; and for assessment of treatment response at CT and MRI.

This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12).

With progression of cirrhosis, there is development of radiologically detectable regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. Amongst these regenerative nodules are completely benign lesions whereas dysplastic nodules, though benign, are considered premalignant; and hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant condition. Differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions is possible on the basis of enhancement pattern in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.

The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109).

      "The normal functioning hepatocytes uptake the hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents and excrete them into the biliary system due to cellular membrane transporters. The contrast agent is responsible for shortening the T1 relaxation, which results in higher signal intensity of the healthy liver parenchyma on T1-WI in the hepatobiliary phase[1]. In the later (hepatobiliary) phase, there is also a subsequent excretion into the biliary canaliculi, allowing imaging of the biliary pathways. Therefore, the hepato-biliary phase is easily recognized because the normal liver parenchyma and bile ducts appear enhanced[41]. Non-hepatocellular lesions, as well as lesions with impaired hepatocytes, appear hypointense. In short, as liver metastases lack functioning hepatocytes and biliary ducts, they appear hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase.

Flusberg et al (7) reported sig-nificant differences in the frequencies of report-ing important elements of HCC imaging, such as major features (Fig 1), observation size, and location, when comparing free-text reports to LI-RADS templates. Structured reports are es-sential for data mining, facilitating calculation of diagnostic performance, and pooling of data from different sites for multicenter studies (11). To our knowledge, no studies have shown det-rimental effects of structured reports. However, criticisms include the risk for errors if prepopu-lated information is not adequately removed, a potential loss of the big picture due to overly structured content, and limitations for describ-ing more complex cases due to rigid and limited descriptors (22). Implementation of structured reports also requires an adaptation period during clinical adoption, which may momentarily affect workflow and productivity (5).\n",

The hyperplastic area is slightly hypointense to hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, with intense homogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase (35). In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36).

Most liver metastases are hypovascular and are best detected during the portal venous phase (PVP), which begins approximately 60-80 s after the initial injection. In this phase, the liver parenchyma enhances through the dominant blood supply by the portal vein. Hypovascular metastases appear as hypodense/hypoattenuating lesions compared to the background liver parenchyma (Figure 3)[1]. They usually show a peripheral rim enhancement in the late arterial phase (LAP), which fades centrally in the venous phase (“target appearance”)[5,6]. On the other hand, hypervascular metastases enhance earlier in the LAP, which is demonstrated by contrast in the portal vein and absence in the hepatic veins. These lesions may fade and become isodense with the remaining liver parenchyma or show variable degrees of washout in the PVP and delayed acquisitions[5,6,20].\n",

The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified.

      "Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compris-ing the vast majority of primary liver malignancies. Imaging plays a central role in HCC diagnosis and management. As a result, the content and structure of radiology reports are of utmost importance in guiding clinical management. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides guidance for standardized report-ing of liver observations in patients who are at risk for HCC. LI-RADS standardized reporting intends to inform patient treatment and facilitate multidisciplinary communication and decisions, taking into consideration individual clinical factors. Depending on the con-text, observations may be reported individually, in aggregate, or as a combination of both. LI-RADS provides two templates for reporting liver observations: in a single continuous paragraph or in a structured format with keywords and imaging findings. The authors clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting, highlight the benefits of structured reports, discuss the applicability of LI-RADS for liver CT and MRI, review the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report, provide guidance on the description of LI-RADS observations ex-emplified with two case-based reporting templates, illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios, and discuss future directions.\n",

      "Radiology reports come in many forms, in-cluding free text, standardized, and structured. Free-text reports may lack clarity and consis-tency, potentially leading to errors in translation to management and longitudinal reporting (4–6). Conversely, standardized or structured reports streamline medical content by using precise ter-minology and are scripted to cover all clinically relevant data, promoting consistent and com-plete reporting of all data elements (5–8). They improve clinical care and workflow by providing systematic image analysis and reduced dictation times when compared with free-text reports (9). Furthermore, the adoption of structured reports facilitates data extraction for indexing, teaching, and research purposes (10,11). Different systems have been developed for the standardization of liver imaging (12). The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a comprehensive approach to all HCC imaging components, from image acquisition to interpre-tation. LI-RADS provides a precise lexicon of imaging features, unambiguous diagnostic cat-egories, and reporting templates for applying the system in practice. A central tenet of LI-RADS is standardization, which is intended to reduce in-terpretation variability, improve communication between health care providers, and ultimately improve patient care. A standardized LI-RADS report is intended to clearly and concisely reflect the radiologist’s diagnostic impression and pro-vides suggested management considerations (13). LI-RADS provides standardization in screening and surveillance with US; in diagnostic imaging with CT, MRI, and contrast-enhanced US; and for assessment of treatment response at CT and MRI. In this article, we clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting and highlight the benefits of structured reports. We discuss the applicabil-ity of LI-RADS and focus on the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report for liver CT and MRI. We provide guidance for describing LI-RADS observations, exemplified with two case-based reporting templates, and illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios. We briefly discuss future directions. While we pro-vide standardized terminology and templates for structured reporting, the level of detail should be adapted according to the preferences and needs of individual radiologists, referrers, practices, institu-tions, regional preferences, and liver transplanta-tion requirements when applicable. A structured report template for liver CT and MRI using LI-RADS is available at https://www.radreport.org/home/RPT50860.\n",

To use LI-RADS, radiologists must first establish that the patient meets the LI-RADS population criteria, namely: cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B infection even in the absence of cirrhosis, or a personal history of HCC. LI-RADS should not be applied to patients without the previously mentioned risk factors, patients younger than 18 years, or patients with congenital hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis due to vascular disorders (26). Depending on the clinical scenario, users may apply the CT and MRI LI-RADS diagnostic algorithm for untreated observa-tions, the LI-RADS Treatment Response (LR-TR) algorithm for assessing response to local-regional treatment of pathologically proven or imaging-presumed malignancies, or both if untreated and treated observations are present (13).\n",

NRH is characterized by diffuse hyperplasic nodules, commonly 1–3 mm in size, and hepatocytes in the absence of fibrosis (8). It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, including lymphop-roliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, auto-immune diseases, drug exposure, and Budd-Chiari syndrome.

NRH may manifest as hypo-, iso-, or hyperintense regions on T1- and T2-weighted MR images (52). In the HBP, NRH shows hyperintensity, with relative hypointensity in the central region of the lesion; this finding is seen as ring or doughnut-like enhancement. The hyperintense portion corresponds to hyperplas-tic hepatocytes that express OATP1B3, and the central hypointense portion corresponds to the portal tracts (4).\n",

      "It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration.

      "Gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, is becoming increasingly important in the detection and characterization of hepatic mass lesions. This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

On the other hand, three-dimensional (3D) CEUS imaging techniques can image the tumor as a whole, provide spatial information, and allow volumetric images. El Kaffas et al[15] showed that 3D dynamic CEUS is superior to 2D dynamic CEUS imaging by reducing the sampling errors from heterogeneous tumor perfusion. Other studies have shown no significant differences between the two modes concerning sensitivity[16].

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

Nevertheless, it has considerable limitations, including dependency on operator expertise, patient’s body habitus, cooperation, and bowel gas interposition[8]. The lower performance of this technique is also explained by limited spatial resolution, and for this reason, small (< 3-5 mm), isoechoic, and deep-seated metastases can be missed[1,8]. The conven-tional US's general sensitivity for detecting liver metastases is approximately 69% (sensitivity of 50%-76% in series with a true gold standard – intraoperative US or resection)[1,9]. This sensitivity is probably lower in patients with subdiaphragmatic lesions, chronic hepatic disease, and severe hepatic steatosis, which may be induced by chemotherapy.

      " At MRI, lymphomas of the liver are homoge-neously hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109). Similarly, nondistorted enhancing biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging findings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (Fig 16) (110).\n",

      "MRI best characterizes focal cirrhotic liver lesions. USG can detect focal lesions but cannot reliably characterize them. CT can reliably characterize the focal lesions and differentiate between regenerative nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may not be able to reliably differentiate dysplastic nodules from regenerative nodules or from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence CT is still less sensitive as well as specific than MRI. MRI is most reliable investigation for suspected hepatocellular malignancy- in detection and also for monitoring of patients in whom the lesions are detected previously. Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion.\n",

      "Results and Conclusions: In cirrhosis, there is development of nodules which are initially only microscopically detectable. With progression of cirrhosis, there is development of radiologically detectable regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. Amongst these regenerative nodules are completely benign lesions whereas dysplastic nodules, though benign, are considered premalignant; and hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant condition. Differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions is possible on the basis of enhancement pattern in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion. Also, MRI characterization after gadolinium based contrast injection was found to be similar to the previous imaging based on non-gadolinium contrast agents.\n",

      "Dynamic imaging is crucial, and its concept, perception, and evaluation are similar between CT and MRI (Figure 2). Most liver metastases are hypovascular and are best detected during the portal venous phase (PVP), which begins approximately 60-80 s after the initial injection. In this phase, the liver parenchyma enhances through the dominant blood supply by the portal vein. Hypovascular metastases appear as hypodense/hypoattenuating lesions compared to the background liver parenchyma (Figure 3)[1]. They usually show a peripheral rim enhancement in the late arterial phase (LAP), which fades centrally in the venous phase (“target appearance”)[5,6]. On the other hand, hypervascular metastases enhance earlier in the LAP, which is demonstrated by contrast in the portal vein and absence in the hepatic veins. These lesions may fade and become isodense with the remaining liver parenchyma or show variable degrees of washout in the PVP and delayed acquisitions[5,6,20].\n",

      "The normal functioning hepatocytes uptake the hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents and excrete them into the biliary system due to cellular membrane transporters. The contrast agent is responsible for shortening the T1 relaxation, which results in higher signal intensity of the healthy liver parenchyma on T1-WI in the hepatobiliary phase[1]. In the later (hepatobiliary) phase, there is also a subsequent excretion into the biliary canaliculi, allowing imaging of the biliary pathways. Therefore, the hepato-biliary phase is easily recognized because the normal liver parenchyma and bile ducts appear enhanced[41]. Non-hepatocellular lesions, as well as lesions with impaired hepatocytes, appear hypointense. In short, as liver metastases lack functioning hepatocytes and biliary ducts, they appear hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase. Allergic reactions are infrequent and comparable with those of extracellular GBCAs.\n",

      "In addition to standardization, structured reports provide several benefits. In a clinical setting, a structured report improves clarity of communica-tion, reduces variability in key feature descrip-tion, and links individual observations to staging and treatment recommendations (19,20). Struc-tured reports promote adherence to guidelines and diagnostics systems, while appropriately doc-umenting technique (21). Finally, they encourage a consistent pattern for image analysis that may reduce diagnostic errors and potentially improve workflow (8,9). Flusberg et al (7) reported sig-nificant differences in the frequencies of report-ing important elements of HCC imaging, such as major features (Fig 1), observation size, and location, when comparing free-text reports to LI-RADS templates. Structured reports are es-sential for data mining, facilitating calculation of diagnostic performance, and pooling of data from different sites for multicenter studies (11). To our knowledge, no studies have shown det-rimental effects of structured reports. However, criticisms include the risk for errors if prepopu-lated information is not adequately removed, a potential loss of the big picture due to overly structured content, and limitations for describ-ing more complex cases due to rigid and limited descriptors (22). Implementation of structured reports also requires an adaptation period during clinical adoption, which may momentarily affect workflow and productivity (5).\n",

      "At MRI, findings of FNH typically include areas of peripheral hyperplastic hepatocytes and central scars (Fig 2). The hyperplastic area is slightly hypointense to hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, with intense homogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase (35). In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36). The majority of hyperplas-tic areas are isointense or hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver tissue during the HBP. This finding enables differential diagnosis (37) because most hypervascular liver masses show hypointensity during the HBP.\n",

In addition, the presence of a central scar favors the presence of an FNH-like lesion. An enhancing capsule, nonperipheral washout, and threshold growth are typical of HCC (43). Other ancil-lary imaging features, such as nodule-in-nodule architecture, fat in a mass, corona enhancement, and restricted diffusion, also favor a diagnosis of HCC (47). However, while most FNH-like lesions exhibit hyperintensity during the HBP, these lesions may show portal venous phase washout and hypointensity during the HBP, mimicking HCC.

In 2012, American College of Radiology developed the Liver Imaging–Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for standardizing terminology and criteria for interpreting and reporting findings of CT and MRI examinations of the liver in patients with cirrhosis or increased risk of HCC. The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified.

      "Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compris-ing the vast majority of primary liver malignancies. Imaging plays a central role in HCC diagnosis and management. As a result, the content and structure of radiology reports are of utmost importance in guiding clinical management. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides guidance for standardized report-ing of liver observations in patients who are at risk for HCC. LI-RADS standardized reporting intends to inform patient treatment and facilitate multidisciplinary communication and decisions, taking into consideration individual clinical factors. Depending on the con-text, observations may be reported individually, in aggregate, or as a combination of both. LI-RADS provides two templates for reporting liver observations: in a single continuous paragraph or in a structured format with keywords and imaging findings. The authors clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting, highlight the benefits of structured reports, discuss the applicability of LI-RADS for liver CT and MRI, review the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report, provide guidance on the description of LI-RADS observations ex-emplified with two case-based reporting templates, illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios, and discuss future directions.\n",

The lexicon standardizes the language of all aspects of liver imaging, including when the LI-RADS algo-rithm is not applicable. LI-RADS lexicon terms are labeled as “LI-RADS specific” or “broad use.” LI-RADS–specific terms are used solely in the context of LI-RADS, such as “threshold growth,” and may not be useful in a broader context. Terms identified for broad use may be applied to any liver imaging study performed for any indication. These lexicon terms can be ad-opted to enable precise and consistent reporting of liver phases, anatomy, and observations.\n",

      "Radiology reports come in many forms, in-cluding free text, standardized, and structured. Free-text reports may lack clarity and consis-tency, potentially leading to errors in translation to management and longitudinal reporting (4–6). Conversely, standardized or structured reports streamline medical content by using precise ter-minology and are scripted to cover all clinically relevant data, promoting consistent and com-plete reporting of all data elements (5–8). They improve clinical care and workflow by providing systematic image analysis and reduced dictation times when compared with free-text reports (9). Furthermore, the adoption of structured reports facilitates data extraction for indexing, teaching, and research purposes (10,11). Different systems have been developed for the standardization of liver imaging (12). The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a comprehensive approach to all HCC imaging components, from image acquisition to interpre-tation. LI-RADS provides a precise lexicon of imaging features, unambiguous diagnostic cat-egories, and reporting templates for applying the system in practice. A central tenet of LI-RADS is standardization, which is intended to reduce in-terpretation variability, improve communication between health care providers, and ultimately improve patient care. A standardized LI-RADS report is intended to clearly and concisely reflect the radiologist’s diagnostic impression and pro-vides suggested management considerations (13). LI-RADS provides standardization in screening and surveillance with US; in diagnostic imaging with CT, MRI, and contrast-enhanced US; and for assessment of treatment response at CT and MRI. In this article, we clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting and highlight the benefits of structured reports. We discuss the applicabil-ity of LI-RADS and focus on the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report for liver CT and MRI. We provide guidance for describing LI-RADS observations, exemplified with two case-based reporting templates, and illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios. We briefly discuss future directions. While we pro-vide standardized terminology and templates for structured reporting, the level of detail should be adapted according to the preferences and needs of individual radiologists, referrers, practices, institu-tions, regional preferences, and liver transplanta-tion requirements when applicable. A structured report template for liver CT and MRI using LI-RADS is available at https://www.radreport.org/home/RPT50860.\n",

      "When to Use LI-RADS AlgorithmsThe first step in LI-RADS standardized report-ing is to identify the appropriate algorithm. To use LI-RADS, radiologists must first establish that the patient meets the LI-RADS population criteria, namely: cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B infection even in the absence of cirrhosis, or a personal history of HCC. LI-RADS should not be applied to patients without the previously mentioned risk factors, patients younger than 18 years, or patients with congenital hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis due to vascular disorders (26). Depending on the clinical scenario, users may apply the CT and MRI LI-RADS diagnostic algorithm for untreated observa-tions, the LI-RADS Treatment Response (LR-TR) algorithm for assessing response to local-regional treatment of pathologically proven or imaging-presumed malignancies, or both if untreated and treated observations are present (13).\n",

It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, including lymphop-roliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, auto-immune diseases, drug exposure, and Budd-Chiari syndrome.

In the HBP, NRH shows hyperintensity, with relative hypointensity in the central region of the lesion; this finding is seen as ring or doughnut-like enhancement.

      " Peritumoral retention during the HBP of gadox-etic acid–enhanced MRI appears as a hyperintense rim surrounding the tumor. This rim is occasion-ally observed in HCCs (Fig 12). In the Yoneda et al study (99), peritumoral retention with partial enhancement was observed in 50% of HCCs. Histopathologically, peritumoral retention corre-sponds to peritumoral hyperplasia, which is defined as a rim of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding the tumor. Peritumoral hyperplasia is also ob-served in other hepatic tumors, such as neuroen-docrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, metastatic colon carcinomas, hemangiomas, and hepatoblastomas (100). Thus, these tumors also can show peritumoral retention during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI (Figs 13, 14).\n",

      "It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration. Thus, this enhancement pattern during the HBP is re-ferred to as a targetoid pattern.\n",

Understanding these causes is useful not only for precise imaging-based diagnosis but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.

      "Gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, is becoming increasingly important in the detection and characterization of hepatic mass lesions. This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

      "Gadoxetic acid (gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [Eovist or Primovist; Bayer Healthcare, Berlin,Germany]) is a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI (1,2). This agent is becoming increas-ingly important for detecting and characterizing lesions in patients known or suspected to have hepatic mass lesions (3,4). During the hepato-biliary phase (HBP), hepatic mass lesions with-out functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity relative to the background liver tissue.

      " Regarding CEUS, reports differ, mainly because they depend more on operator expertise and other technical factors. Bernatik et al[11] found that CEUS detected 97% of the lesions diagnosed by CT[8,11]. Piscaglia et al[12] examined 109 patients with colorectal and gastric cancer. They showed that CEUS improves sensitivity in the detection of liver metastases to 95.4% when compared to conventional US (76.9%) and CT (90.8%)[12]. Cantisani et al[8,13] showed that CEUS improved US sensitivity from 67.4%-71.6% to 93.4%-95.8%. On the other hand, Vialle et al[14] reported that the CEUS sensitivity was inferior to CT in detecting hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CEUS 64.5% vs CT 80.4%). Moreover, since metastatic liver disease frequently shows multiple lesions, the per-lesion evaluation would need multiple doses of ultrasound contrast agent[7].\n",

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

      "With the introduction of surgical removal of metastatic liver nodules, the overall survival rate has increased. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the best imaging method to detect them, mainly the smaller ones, which can be easily missed.

Consequently, it appears obvious that in metastases that are \"too small to characterize,\" CT has a limited role, particularly for those smaller than 5 mm[50].

      "with cirrhosis, US does not allow detection of more than one-half of early-stage HCCs (26). This is partly explained by the poor acoustic window because of cirrhosis, body habitus, or liver steato­sis (6). Prospective evaluation has shown reduced sensitivity and specificity and higher likelihood of US inadequacy in male patients and in those with a larger body habitus, an echogenic or nodular liver due to high fat content or fibrosis, and ascites (6,27,28). Studies have shown that the per-patient sensitivity of US for small HCCs (<2 cm), defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A, is as low as 47%–63% (5,26,29). A 13-year meta-analysis (30) in which US was compared with al­ternative surveillance strategies found US to have the lowest overall sensitivity and positive predictive value (59.3% and 77.4%, respectively), compared with contrast material–enhanced CT (73.6% and 85.8%, respectively) and contrast-enhanced MRI (77.5% and 83.6%, respectively). US with intravascular contrast material im­proves liver lesion conspicuity compared with that at standard US (31). However, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of intravascular contrast–enhanced US in primary surveillance of liver cancers. Growing evidence supports the use of perfluorobutane microbubble enhance­ment with US. This contrast agent is taken up by the Kupffer cells, allowing for Kupffer phase imaging, which is similar to hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at MRI with hepatobiliary agents. In a randomized controlled study (32) comparing perfluorobutane-enhanced US to gray-scale US for surveillance of HCC, Kupffer phase imaging allowed detection of significantly smaller HCCs. Unfortunately, at this time, Kupffer cell contrast-enhanced US agents are not available for use in the United States.\n",

      "UltrasonographyUltrasonography (US) is a safe, accessible, and inexpensive technique. Nevertheless, it has considerable limitations, including dependency on operator expertise, patient’s body habitus, cooperation, and bowel gas interposition[8]. The lower performance of this technique is also explained by limited spatial resolution, and for this reason, small (< 3-5 mm), isoechoic, and deep-seated metastases can be missed[1,8]. The conven-tional US's general sensitivity for detecting liver metastases is approximately 69% (sensitivity of 50%-76% in series with a true gold standard – intraoperative US or resection)[1,9]. This sensitivity is probably lower in patients with subdiaphragmatic lesions, chronic hepatic disease, and severe hepatic steatosis, which may be induced by chemotherapy. Moreover, the ambiguity in segmental localization leads to a lack of reproducibility compared to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n",

      " Biliary tract enhancement is caused by the physiologic excretion of gadoxetic acid into the bile ducts and therefore is usually strong. IPNB can show a dilated enhanced bile duct with fill-ing defects caused by mucin retention or a solid component of the tumor. Enhanced nondistorted biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging find-ings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. The differential diagnosis of hyperintense liver masses seen during the HBP is summarized in Figure 17.\n",

      "At MRI, lymphomas of the liver are homoge-neously hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109). Similarly, nondistorted enhancing biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging findings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (Fig 16) (110).\n",

      "MRI best characterizes focal cirrhotic liver lesions. USG can detect focal lesions but cannot reliably characterize them. CT can reliably characterize the focal lesions and differentiate between regenerative nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may not be able to reliably differentiate dysplastic nodules from regenerative nodules or from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence CT is still less sensitive as well as specific than MRI. MRI is most reliable investigation for suspected hepatocellular malignancy- in detection and also for monitoring of patients in whom the lesions are detected previously. Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion.\n",

      "Malignant LymphomaPrimary lymphoma of the liver is a rare ma-lignant tumor, accounting for fewer than 1% of extranodal lymphomas. In contrast, hepatic extension (ie, secondary malignant lymphoma) in stage IV lymphoma has been observed in 15% of cases (15,16). Primary lymphomas of the liver are mainly large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

      "Results and Conclusions: In cirrhosis, there is development of nodules which are initially only microscopically detectable. With progression of cirrhosis, there is development of radiologically detectable regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. Amongst these regenerative nodules are completely benign lesions whereas dysplastic nodules, though benign, are considered premalignant; and hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant condition. Differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions is possible on the basis of enhancement pattern in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion. Also, MRI characterization after gadolinium based contrast injection was found to be similar to the previous imaging based on non-gadolinium contrast agents.\n",

Activation of β-catenin promotes the expression of target genes, including Wnt/β-catenin pathway components. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) activation is also disrupted due to OATP1B3 overexpression, which affects the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, ultimately impacting the function of HNF4α. This results in a complex interplay between β-catenin and HNF4α activation, which is disrupted by OATP1B3 overexpression.  \n",

Owing to β-catenin gene mutation, B-HCA has the high-est risk for malignant transformation. In addition, B-HCA is the most common HCA subtype that takes up gadoxetic acid. According to previous reports (59,63,66), more than 80% of B-HCA lesions show isointensity or hyperintensity during the HBP (Fig 6). It also has been reported that glutamine synthetase and OATP1B3, which are downstream targets of the Wnt/β-catenin path-way, are diffusely positive in immunohistochemi-cal studies of B-HCA (4,67). Such preserved or increased OATP1B3 expression has been shown to correlate with the hyperintensity seen during the HBP (63,68).

      "The normal functioning hepatocytes uptake the hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents and excrete them into the biliary system due to cellular membrane transporters. The contrast agent is responsible for shortening the T1 relaxation, which results in higher signal intensity of the healthy liver parenchyma on T1-WI in the hepatobiliary phase[1]. In the later (hepatobiliary) phase, there is also a subsequent excretion into the biliary canaliculi, allowing imaging of the biliary pathways. Therefore, the hepato-biliary phase is easily recognized because the normal liver parenchyma and bile ducts appear enhanced[41]. Non-hepatocellular lesions, as well as lesions with impaired hepatocytes, appear hypointense. In short, as liver metastases lack functioning hepatocytes and biliary ducts, they appear hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase. Allergic reactions are infrequent and comparable with those of extracellular GBCAs.\n",

      "In addition to standardization, structured reports provide several benefits. In a clinical setting, a structured report improves clarity of communica-tion, reduces variability in key feature descrip-tion, and links individual observations to staging and treatment recommendations (19,20). Struc-tured reports promote adherence to guidelines and diagnostics systems, while appropriately doc-umenting technique (21). Finally, they encourage a consistent pattern for image analysis that may reduce diagnostic errors and potentially improve workflow (8,9). Flusberg et al (7) reported sig-nificant differences in the frequencies of report-ing important elements of HCC imaging, such as major features (Fig 1), observation size, and location, when comparing free-text reports to LI-RADS templates. Structured reports are es-sential for data mining, facilitating calculation of diagnostic performance, and pooling of data from different sites for multicenter studies (11). To our knowledge, no studies have shown det-rimental effects of structured reports. However, criticisms include the risk for errors if prepopu-lated information is not adequately removed, a potential loss of the big picture due to overly structured content, and limitations for describ-ing more complex cases due to rigid and limited descriptors (22). Implementation of structured reports also requires an adaptation period during clinical adoption, which may momentarily affect workflow and productivity (5).\n",

The hyperplastic area is slightly hypointense to hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, with intense homogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase (35). In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36). The majority of hyperplas-tic areas are isointense or hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver tissue during the HBP.

These mechanisms include uptake by hyperplastic hepatocytes, tumor cells, retention in extracellular space, peritumoral retention, and biliary enhancement. Recognizing these mechanisms enables radiologists to accurately interpret imaging findings and understand the pathogenesis of these lesions, which can aid in differential diagnoses such as Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH), FNH-like lesions, and Non-Neoplastic Hyperplastic Hepatocellular Carcinoma (NRH). \n",

      " Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compris-ing the vast majority of primary liver malignancies. Imaging plays a central role in HCC diagnosis and management. As a result, the content and structure of radiology reports are of utmost importance in guiding clinical management. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides guidance for standardized report-ing of liver observations in patients who are at risk for HCC. LI-RADS standardized reporting intends to inform patient treatment and facilitate multidisciplinary communication and decisions, taking into consideration individual clinical factors. Depending on the con-text, observations may be reported individually, in aggregate, or as a combination of both. LI-RADS provides two templates for reporting liver observations: in a single continuous paragraph or in a structured format with keywords and imaging findings. The authors clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting, highlight the benefits of structured reports, discuss the applicability of LI-RADS for liver CT and MRI, review the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report, provide guidance on the description of LI-RADS observations ex-emplified with two case-based reporting templates, illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios, and discuss future directions.\n",

In 2012, American College of Radiology developed the Liver Imaging–Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for standardizing terminology and criteria for interpreting and reporting findings of CT and MRI examinations of the liver in patients with cirrhosis or increased risk of HCC. The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified. This version applies to multiphase CT and MRI examinations performed with conventional extracellular contrast materials. It currently, does not apply to hepatobiliary specific gadolinium-based agents.\n",

      "Radiology reports come in many forms, in-cluding free text, standardized, and structured. Free-text reports may lack clarity and consis-tency, potentially leading to errors in translation to management and longitudinal reporting (4–6). Conversely, standardized or structured reports streamline medical content by using precise ter-minology and are scripted to cover all clinically relevant data, promoting consistent and com-plete reporting of all data elements (5–8). They improve clinical care and workflow by providing systematic image analysis and reduced dictation times when compared with free-text reports (9). Furthermore, the adoption of structured reports facilitates data extraction for indexing, teaching, and research purposes (10,11). Different systems have been developed for the standardization of liver imaging (12). The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a comprehensive approach to all HCC imaging components, from image acquisition to interpre-tation. LI-RADS provides a precise lexicon of imaging features, unambiguous diagnostic cat-egories, and reporting templates for applying the system in practice. A central tenet of LI-RADS is standardization, which is intended to reduce in-terpretation variability, improve communication between health care providers, and ultimately improve patient care. A standardized LI-RADS report is intended to clearly and concisely reflect the radiologist’s diagnostic impression and pro-vides suggested management considerations (13). LI-RADS provides standardization in screening and surveillance with US; in diagnostic imaging with CT, MRI, and contrast-enhanced US; and for assessment of treatment response at CT and MRI. In this article, we clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting and highlight the benefits of structured reports. We discuss the applicabil-ity of LI-RADS and focus on the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report for liver CT and MRI. We provide guidance for describing LI-RADS observations, exemplified with two case-based reporting templates, and illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios. We briefly discuss future directions. While we pro-vide standardized terminology and templates for structured reporting, the level of detail should be adapted according to the preferences and needs of individual radiologists, referrers, practices, institu-tions, regional preferences, and liver transplanta-tion requirements when applicable. A structured report template for liver CT and MRI using LI-RADS is available at https://www.radreport.org/home/RPT50860.\n",

      " Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can detect hepatocellular carcinomas, but other types of hepatic tumors can also exhibit peritumoral retention, such as hepatoid mesenchymal tumors, and hepatic adenomas. This phenomenon is due to the retention of contrast agent by the tumor cells or by the surrounding stroma. In the case of hepatoid mesenchymal tumors, the retention is thought to be due to the expression of certain adhesion molecules or other surface proteins that facilitate the uptake of the contrast agent. In the case of hepatic adenomas, the retention is thought to be due to the presence of certain lipids or other substances that are retained by the tumor cells or surrounding stroma.  \n",

      " Gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, is becoming increasingly important in the detection and characterization of hepatic mass lesions. This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

      "It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration. Thus, this enhancement pattern during the HBP is re-ferred to as a targetoid pattern.\n",

In the Yoneda et al study (99), peritumoral retention with partial enhancement was observed in 50% of HCCs. Histopathologically, peritumoral retention corre-sponds to peritumoral hyperplasia, which is defined as a rim of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding the tumor. Peritumoral hyperplasia is also ob-served in other hepatic tumors, such as neuroen-docrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, metastatic colon carcinomas, hemangiomas, and hepatoblastomas (100).

      "The normal functioning hepatocytes uptake the hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents and excrete them into the biliary system due to cellular membrane transporters. The contrast agent is responsible for shortening the T1 relaxation, which results in higher signal intensity of the healthy liver parenchyma on T1-WI in the hepatobiliary phase[1]. In the later (hepatobiliary) phase, there is also a subsequent excretion into the biliary canaliculi, allowing imaging of the biliary pathways. Therefore, the hepato-biliary phase is easily recognized because the normal liver parenchyma and bile ducts appear enhanced[41]. Non-hepatocellular lesions, as well as lesions with impaired hepatocytes, appear hypointense. In short, as liver metastases lack functioning hepatocytes and biliary ducts, they appear hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase. Allergic reactions are infrequent and comparable with those of extracellular GBCAs.\n",

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

      "The accuracy for the detection of hepatic lesions may differ with the US mode. Two-dimensional (2D) CEUS shows limitations in evaluating liver metastases since it is more prone to sampling errors, such as imaging caption of a single section and plane-to-plane perfusion variation. On the other hand, three-dimensional (3D) CEUS imaging techniques can image the tumor as a whole, provide spatial information, and allow volumetric images. El Kaffas et al[15] showed that 3D dynamic CEUS is superior to 2D dynamic CEUS imaging by reducing the sampling errors from heterogeneous tumor perfusion. Other studies have shown no significant differences between the two modes concerning sensitivity[16]. Nevertheless, the perception of the feeding arteries is improved with the 3D CEUS, which might be helpful for the treatment of hypervascular liver metastases[16].\n",

Nevertheless, it has considerable limitations, including dependency on operator expertise, patient’s body habitus, cooperation, and bowel gas interposition[8]. The lower performance of this technique is also explained by limited spatial resolution, and for this reason, small (< 3-5 mm), isoechoic, and deep-seated metastases can be missed[1,8]. The conven-tional US's general sensitivity for detecting liver metastases is approximately 69% (sensitivity of 50%-76% in series with a true gold standard – intraoperative US or resection)[1,9]. This sensitivity is probably lower in patients with subdiaphragmatic lesions, chronic hepatic disease, and severe hepatic steatosis, which may be induced by chemotherapy.

      "with cirrhosis, US does not allow detection of more than one-half of early-stage HCCs (26). This is partly explained by the poor acoustic window because of cirrhosis, body habitus, or liver steato­sis (6). Prospective evaluation has shown reduced sensitivity and specificity and higher likelihood of US inadequacy in male patients and in those with a larger body habitus, an echogenic or nodular liver due to high fat content or fibrosis, and ascites (6,27,28). Studies have shown that the per-patient sensitivity of US for small HCCs (<2 cm), defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A, is as low as 47%–63% (5,26,29). A 13-year meta-analysis (30) in which US was compared with al­ternative surveillance strategies found US to have the lowest overall sensitivity and positive predictive value (59.3% and 77.4%, respectively), compared with contrast material–enhanced CT (73.6% and 85.8%, respectively) and contrast-enhanced MRI (77.5% and 83.6%, respectively). US with intravascular contrast material im­proves liver lesion conspicuity compared with that at standard US (31). However, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of intravascular contrast–enhanced US in primary surveillance of liver cancers. Growing evidence supports the use of perfluorobutane microbubble enhance­ment with US. This contrast agent is taken up by the Kupffer cells, allowing for Kupffer phase imaging, which is similar to hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at MRI with hepatobiliary agents. In a randomized controlled study (32) comparing perfluorobutane-enhanced US to gray-scale US for surveillance of HCC, Kupffer phase imaging allowed detection of significantly smaller HCCs. Unfortunately, at this time, Kupffer cell contrast-enhanced US agents are not available for use in the United States.\n",

      " At MRI, lymphomas of the liver are homoge-neously hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109). Similarly, nondistorted enhancing biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging findings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (Fig 16) (110).\n",

      "Biliary tract enhancement is caused by the physiologic excretion of gadoxetic acid into the bile ducts and therefore is usually strong. IPNB can show a dilated enhanced bile duct with fill-ing defects caused by mucin retention or a solid component of the tumor. Enhanced nondistorted biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging find-ings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. The differential diagnosis of hyperintense liver masses seen during the HBP is summarized in Figure 17.\n",

      "MRI best characterizes focal cirrhotic liver lesions. USG can detect focal lesions but cannot reliably characterize them. CT can reliably characterize the focal lesions and differentiate between regenerative nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may not be able to reliably differentiate dysplastic nodules from regenerative nodules or from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence CT is still less sensitive as well as specific than MRI. MRI is most reliable investigation for suspected hepatocellular malignancy- in detection and also for monitoring of patients in whom the lesions are detected previously. Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion.\n",

In contrast, hepatic extension (ie, secondary malignant lymphoma) in stage IV lymphoma has been observed in 15% of cases (15,16). Primary lymphomas of the liver are mainly large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

      "Results and Conclusions: In cirrhosis, there is development of nodules which are initially only microscopically detectable. With progression of cirrhosis, there is development of radiologically detectable regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. Amongst these regenerative nodules are completely benign lesions whereas dysplastic nodules, though benign, are considered premalignant; and hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant condition. Differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions is possible on the basis of enhancement pattern in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion. Also, MRI characterization after gadolinium based contrast injection was found to be similar to the previous imaging based on non-gadolinium contrast agents.\n",

      "Dynamic imaging is crucial, and its concept, perception, and evaluation are similar between CT and MRI (Figure 2). Most liver metastases are hypovascular and are best detected during the portal venous phase (PVP), which begins approximately 60-80 s after the initial injection. In this phase, the liver parenchyma enhances through the dominant blood supply by the portal vein. Hypovascular metastases appear as hypodense/hypoattenuating lesions compared to the background liver parenchyma (Figure 3)[1]. They usually show a peripheral rim enhancement in the late arterial phase (LAP), which fades centrally in the venous phase (“target appearance”)[5,6]. On the other hand, hypervascular metastases enhance earlier in the LAP, which is demonstrated by contrast in the portal vein and absence in the hepatic veins. These lesions may fade and become isodense with the remaining liver parenchyma or show variable degrees of washout in the PVP and delayed acquisitions[5,6,20].\n",

      "The normal functioning hepatocytes uptake the hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents and excrete them into the biliary system due to cellular membrane transporters. The contrast agent is responsible for shortening the T1 relaxation, which results in higher signal intensity of the healthy liver parenchyma on T1-WI in the hepatobiliary phase[1]. In the later (hepatobiliary) phase, there is also a subsequent excretion into the biliary canaliculi, allowing imaging of the biliary pathways. Therefore, the hepato-biliary phase is easily recognized because the normal liver parenchyma and bile ducts appear enhanced[41]. Non-hepatocellular lesions, as well as lesions with impaired hepatocytes, appear hypointense. In short, as liver metastases lack functioning hepatocytes and biliary ducts, they appear hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase. Allergic reactions are infrequent and comparable with those of extracellular GBCAs.\n",

      "In addition to standardization, structured reports provide several benefits. In a clinical setting, a structured report improves clarity of communica-tion, reduces variability in key feature descrip-tion, and links individual observations to staging and treatment recommendations (19,20). Struc-tured reports promote adherence to guidelines and diagnostics systems, while appropriately doc-umenting technique (21). Finally, they encourage a consistent pattern for image analysis that may reduce diagnostic errors and potentially improve workflow (8,9). Flusberg et al (7) reported sig-nificant differences in the frequencies of report-ing important elements of HCC imaging, such as major features (Fig 1), observation size, and location, when comparing free-text reports to LI-RADS templates. Structured reports are es-sential for data mining, facilitating calculation of diagnostic performance, and pooling of data from different sites for multicenter studies (11). To our knowledge, no studies have shown det-rimental effects of structured reports. However, criticisms include the risk for errors if prepopu-lated information is not adequately removed, a potential loss of the big picture due to overly structured content, and limitations for describ-ing more complex cases due to rigid and limited descriptors (22). Implementation of structured reports also requires an adaptation period during clinical adoption, which may momentarily affect workflow and productivity (5).\n",

The hyperplastic area is slightly hypointense to hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, with intense homogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase (35). In FNH, the presence of fat, which demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase gradient-echo MR images compared with the signal intensity seen on in-phase images, is extremely rare (36). The majority of hyperplas-tic areas are isointense or hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver tissue during the HBP.

In addition, the presence of a central scar favors the presence of an FNH-like lesion. An enhancing capsule, nonperipheral washout, and threshold growth are typical of HCC (43). Other ancil-lary imaging features, such as nodule-in-nodule architecture, fat in a mass, corona enhancement, and restricted diffusion, also favor a diagnosis of HCC (47). However, while most FNH-like lesions exhibit hyperintensity during the HBP, these lesions may show portal venous phase washout and hypointensity during the HBP, mimicking HCC.

The differ-ential diagnosis of those among these lesions that have ring or doughnut-like enhancement includes liver tumors that show peritumoral retention dur-ing the HBP. Peritumoral retention corresponds to peritumoral hyperplastic hepatocytes sur-rounding the tumor; thus, peritumoral retention can also show marked hyperintensity during the HBP.

      " Understanding the mechanisms of hyperintensity in hepatic mass lesions during the HBP is crucial for radiologists to accurately interpret imaging findings and differentiate between various lesions. The mechanisms of hyperintensity include uptake by hyperplastic hepatocytes, tumor cells, retention in extracellular space, peritumoral retention, and biliary enhancement. Recognizing these mechanisms enables radiologists to identify specific characteristics of each lesion, such as the presence of a central scar or ring-like enhancement, and to narrow down differential diagnoses. This understanding also contributes to the pathogenesis of these lesions, allowing radiologists to better comprehend the underlying biology and molecular conditions. \n",

In 2012, American College of Radiology developed the Liver Imaging–Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for standardizing terminology and criteria for interpreting and reporting findings of CT and MRI examinations of the liver in patients with cirrhosis or increased risk of HCC. The LI-RADS classifies lesions to five categories ranging from definitely benign to definitely HCC on the basis of several criteria, such as mass-like configuration, increase in size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, portal venous phase or later phase hypoenhancement, presence of tumor capsule, and vein involvement. In the latest 2013.1 version, LI-RADS and UNOS OPTN categorizations have been unified. This version applies to multiphase CT and MRI examinations performed with conventional extracellular contrast materials. It currently, does not apply to hepatobiliary specific gadolinium-based agents.\n",

      "Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compris-ing the vast majority of primary liver malignancies. Imaging plays a central role in HCC diagnosis and management. As a result, the content and structure of radiology reports are of utmost importance in guiding clinical management. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides guidance for standardized report-ing of liver observations in patients who are at risk for HCC. LI-RADS standardized reporting intends to inform patient treatment and facilitate multidisciplinary communication and decisions, taking into consideration individual clinical factors. Depending on the con-text, observations may be reported individually, in aggregate, or as a combination of both. LI-RADS provides two templates for reporting liver observations: in a single continuous paragraph or in a structured format with keywords and imaging findings. The authors clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting, highlight the benefits of structured reports, discuss the applicability of LI-RADS for liver CT and MRI, review the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report, provide guidance on the description of LI-RADS observations ex-emplified with two case-based reporting templates, illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios, and discuss future directions.\n",

The lexicon standardizes the language of all aspects of liver imaging, including when the LI-RADS algo-rithm is not applicable. LI-RADS lexicon terms are labeled as “LI-RADS specific” or “broad use.” LI-RADS–specific terms are used solely in the context of LI-RADS, such as “threshold growth,” and may not be useful in a broader context. Terms identified for broad use may be applied to any liver imaging study performed for any indication.

      "Radiology reports come in many forms, in-cluding free text, standardized, and structured. Free-text reports may lack clarity and consis-tency, potentially leading to errors in translation to management and longitudinal reporting (4–6). Conversely, standardized or structured reports streamline medical content by using precise ter-minology and are scripted to cover all clinically relevant data, promoting consistent and com-plete reporting of all data elements (5–8). They improve clinical care and workflow by providing systematic image analysis and reduced dictation times when compared with free-text reports (9). Furthermore, the adoption of structured reports facilitates data extraction for indexing, teaching, and research purposes (10,11). Different systems have been developed for the standardization of liver imaging (12). The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a comprehensive approach to all HCC imaging components, from image acquisition to interpre-tation. LI-RADS provides a precise lexicon of imaging features, unambiguous diagnostic cat-egories, and reporting templates for applying the system in practice. A central tenet of LI-RADS is standardization, which is intended to reduce in-terpretation variability, improve communication between health care providers, and ultimately improve patient care. A standardized LI-RADS report is intended to clearly and concisely reflect the radiologist’s diagnostic impression and pro-vides suggested management considerations (13). LI-RADS provides standardization in screening and surveillance with US; in diagnostic imaging with CT, MRI, and contrast-enhanced US; and for assessment of treatment response at CT and MRI. In this article, we clarify terminology that is pertinent to reporting and highlight the benefits of structured reports. We discuss the applicabil-ity of LI-RADS and focus on the elements of a standardized LI-RADS report for liver CT and MRI. We provide guidance for describing LI-RADS observations, exemplified with two case-based reporting templates, and illustrate relevant imaging findings and components to be included when reporting specific clinical scenarios. We briefly discuss future directions. While we pro-vide standardized terminology and templates for structured reporting, the level of detail should be adapted according to the preferences and needs of individual radiologists, referrers, practices, institu-tions, regional preferences, and liver transplanta-tion requirements when applicable. A structured report template for liver CT and MRI using LI-RADS is available at https://www.radreport.org/home/RPT50860.\n",

      "When to Use LI-RADS AlgorithmsThe first step in LI-RADS standardized report-ing is to identify the appropriate algorithm. To use LI-RADS, radiologists must first establish that the patient meets the LI-RADS population criteria, namely: cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B infection even in the absence of cirrhosis, or a personal history of HCC. LI-RADS should not be applied to patients without the previously mentioned risk factors, patients younger than 18 years, or patients with congenital hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis due to vascular disorders (26). Depending on the clinical scenario, users may apply the CT and MRI LI-RADS diagnostic algorithm for untreated observa-tions, the LI-RADS Treatment Response (LR-TR) algorithm for assessing response to local-regional treatment of pathologically proven or imaging-presumed malignancies, or both if untreated and treated observations are present (13).\n",

It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, including lymphop-roliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, auto-immune diseases, drug exposure, and Budd-Chiari syndrome.

In the HBP, NRH shows hyperintensity, with relative hypointensity in the central region of the lesion; this finding is seen as ring or doughnut-like enhancement.

In the Yoneda et al study (99), peritumoral retention with partial enhancement was observed in 50% of HCCs. Histopathologically, peritumoral retention corre-sponds to peritumoral hyperplasia, which is defined as a rim of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding the tumor. Peritumoral hyperplasia is also ob-served in other hepatic tumors, such as neuroen-docrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, metastatic colon carcinomas, hemangiomas, and hepatoblastomas (100). Thus, these tumors also can show peritumoral retention during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI (Figs 13, 14).\n",

      "It is well known that areas of delayed or prolonged liver tumor enhancement at con-ventional extracellular contrast-enhanced CT or MRI correspond to fibrotic stroma at his-topathologic examination (87). Similarly, liver tumors with fibrous stroma, such as cholangio-carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma, pos-sibly are iso- to hyperintense during the HBP of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI because of ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space (Fig 9). In previous studies (88,89), almost 80% of cholangiocarcinomas demonstrated ga-doxetic acid retention in the extracellular space. In addition, 47%–70% of metastatic carcino-mas also show retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space (90–92). Such gadoxetic acid retention in the extracellular space is often observed in the center of the tumor, represent-ing fibrotic stroma or degeneration. Thus, this enhancement pattern during the HBP is re-ferred to as a targetoid pattern.\n",

      "Gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI, is becoming increasingly important in the detection and characterization of hepatic mass lesions. This medium is taken up by functioning hepatocytes, and the liver parenchyma is strongly enhanced in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), during which hepatic mass lesions without functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity. However, some hepatic mass lesions show hyperin-tensity in the HBP. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like lesions show hyperintensity in the HBP owing to the uptake of gadoxetic acid by hyperplastic normal hepatocytes. The tumor cells of some types of hepatocellular adenoma (eg, β-catenin–acti-vated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, green hepatoma) can show uptake of gadoxetic acid. Retention of gadoxetic acid in the extracellular space can cause hyperintensity of fibrotic tumors or hemangiomas during the HBP owing to the extracellular contrast agent characteristics of gadoxetic acid. During the HBP, peritumoral retention is observed in some tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors. Gadoxetic acid is excreted into the bile; therefore, biliary tract enhancement can be observed in the cystic components of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intratumoral bile ducts can be observed in malignant lymphomas. Knowledge of these specific mechanisms, which can cause hyperin-tensity during the HBP depending on the pathologic or molecular background, is important not only for precise imaging-based diag-noses but also for understanding the pathogenesis of hepatic mass lesions.\n",

      "Gadoxetic acid (gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [Eovist or Primovist; Bayer Healthcare, Berlin,Germany]) is a hepatobiliary-specific contrast medium used for MRI (1,2). This agent is becoming increas-ingly important for detecting and characterizing lesions in patients known or suspected to have hepatic mass lesions (3,4). During the hepato-biliary phase (HBP), hepatic mass lesions with-out functioning hepatocytes commonly show hypointensity relative to the background liver tissue. Compared with conventional extracellular contrast material–enhanced CT or MRI, gadox-etic acid–enhanced MRI has been proven to have higher sensitivity in the detection of hepatic mass lesions because of this feature (5,6).\n",

      " Regarding CEUS, reports differ, mainly because they depend more on operator expertise and other technical factors. Bernatik et al[11] found that CEUS detected 97% of the lesions diagnosed by CT[8,11]. Piscaglia et al[12] examined 109 patients with colorectal and gastric cancer. They showed that CEUS improves sensitivity in the detection of liver metastases to 95.4% when compared to conventional US (76.9%) and CT (90.8%)[12]. Cantisani et al[8,13] showed that CEUS improved US sensitivity from 67.4%-71.6% to 93.4%-95.8%. On the other hand, Vialle et al[14] reported that the CEUS sensitivity was inferior to CT in detecting hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CEUS 64.5% vs CT 80.4%). Moreover, since metastatic liver disease frequently shows multiple lesions, the per-lesion evaluation would need multiple doses of ultrasound contrast agent[7].\n",

      "Several studies reported that CE-MRI is more sensitive and specific than CE-CT for detecting liver metastases, mainly due to high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, technical versatility, sensitivity to blood flow, and contrast enhancement and biochemical information[6]. Vreugdenburg et al[32] confirmed in their systematic meta-analysis that in terms of per-lesion diagnostic accuracy, GA-MRI is superior to CE-CT (sensitivity 86.9%-100% vs 51.8%-84.6% and specificity 80.2%-98% vs 77.2%-98%). This difference is more evident in lesions smaller than 10 mm, in which GA-MRI is notably more sensitive but less specific. Based on the reported sensitivity, an equivocal result will happen more frequently with CE-CT, which leads to a modest impact on patient prognosis and management. In 2017, similar results were reported by Choi et al[48], who compared MRI, CT, and PET/CT for the detection of CRC liver metastases, showing a sensitivity of 93.1% vs 82.1% vs 74.1% and specificity of 87.3%, 73.5%, and 93.9%, respectively (Figure 12). MRI showed a better accuracy than CT in detecting CRC liver metastases and presented an incremental value when added to CT alone to detect additional metastases[48]. In this study, the authors reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the sensitivity of both CT and MRI; however, it does not significantly affect the sensitivity of PET/CT[48].\n",

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the best imaging method to detect them, mainly the smaller ones, which can be easily missed. Ko et al[50] showed that the sensitivity of CT was 8%, 55%, 91%, and 100% for nodules of 1-5 mm, 6-10 mm, 11-15 mm, and > 20 mm, respectively. Consequently, it appears obvious that in metastases that are \"too small to characterize,\" CT has a limited role, particularly for those smaller than 5 mm[50].

      "with cirrhosis, US does not allow detection of more than one-half of early-stage HCCs (26). This is partly explained by the poor acoustic window because of cirrhosis, body habitus, or liver steato­sis (6). Prospective evaluation has shown reduced sensitivity and specificity and higher likelihood of US inadequacy in male patients and in those with a larger body habitus, an echogenic or nodular liver due to high fat content or fibrosis, and ascites (6,27,28). Studies have shown that the per-patient sensitivity of US for small HCCs (<2 cm), defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A, is as low as 47%–63% (5,26,29). A 13-year meta-analysis (30) in which US was compared with al­ternative surveillance strategies found US to have the lowest overall sensitivity and positive predictive value (59.3% and 77.4%, respectively), compared with contrast material–enhanced CT (73.6% and 85.8%, respectively) and contrast-enhanced MRI (77.5% and 83.6%, respectively). US with intravascular contrast material im­proves liver lesion conspicuity compared with that at standard US (31). However, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of intravascular contrast–enhanced US in primary surveillance of liver cancers. Growing evidence supports the use of perfluorobutane microbubble enhance­ment with US. This contrast agent is taken up by the Kupffer cells, allowing for Kupffer phase imaging, which is similar to hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at MRI with hepatobiliary agents. In a randomized controlled study (32) comparing perfluorobutane-enhanced US to gray-scale US for surveillance of HCC, Kupffer phase imaging allowed detection of significantly smaller HCCs. Unfortunately, at this time, Kupffer cell contrast-enhanced US agents are not available for use in the United States.\n",

      "UltrasonographyUltrasonography (US) is a safe, accessible, and inexpensive technique. Nevertheless, it has considerable limitations, including dependency on operator expertise, patient’s body habitus, cooperation, and bowel gas interposition[8]. The lower performance of this technique is also explained by limited spatial resolution, and for this reason, small (< 3-5 mm), isoechoic, and deep-seated metastases can be missed[1,8]. The conven-tional US's general sensitivity for detecting liver metastases is approximately 69% (sensitivity of 50%-76% in series with a true gold standard – intraoperative US or resection)[1,9]. This sensitivity is probably lower in patients with subdiaphragmatic lesions, chronic hepatic disease, and severe hepatic steatosis, which may be induced by chemotherapy. Moreover, the ambiguity in segmental localization leads to a lack of reproducibility compared to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n",

      "At MRI, lymphomas of the liver are homoge-neously hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The signal intensity at T1- and T2-weighted MRI may be heterogeneous owing to foci of hemor-rhage and necrosis. T2-hypointense tumors with a peripheral rim of hyperintensity also have been reported. The increased signal intensity around the lesion has been attributed to the inflam-matory response elicited by the lymphomatous lesion and the resultant surrounding edema. The highly cellular nature of lymphoma typically results in markedly restricted diffusion. The ma-jority of these lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement during all phases. The other pattern is that of enhancement of the lesion rim with a central nonenhancing area, resulting in a target-like appearance of the lesion (108). Vascular structures such as portal and hepatic veins in the tumor, with no distortions in size or direction, are highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma (109). Similarly, nondistorted enhancing biliary ducts in the tumor are useful imaging findings in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (Fig 16) (110).\n",

Although ultrasound is used for monitoring the patients in early stages of cirrhosis, MRI has high sensitivity and specificity.

With progression of cirrhosis, there is development of radiologically detectable regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. Amongst these regenerative nodules are completely benign lesions whereas dysplastic nodules, though benign, are considered premalignant; and hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant condition. Differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions is possible on the basis of enhancement pattern in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. The signal characteristics of focal lesions and other findings like portal vein thrombosis are helpful, give additional clue to the diagnosis and also helpful in assigning LIRADS grade to a lesion. Also, MRI characterization after gadolinium based contrast injection was found to be similar to the previous imaging based on non-gadolinium contrast agents.\n",
